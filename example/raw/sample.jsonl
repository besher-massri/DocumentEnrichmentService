In that case a fail decision shall be recorded.\n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By derogation from point 6.2.1, the following procedure shall apply for engine types with a sales volume within the EU of less than 100 units per year:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.1.\n\n\nOne engine and, if applicable, one after-treatment system shall be taken randomly for inspection from the series production of the engine type under consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2.\n\n\nIf the engine meets the requirements outlined in point 6.2.4, a pass decision is reached and no further test is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.3.\n\n\nIf the test does not satisfy the requirements outlined in point 6.2.4, the procedure outlined in points 6.2.6 to 6.2.9 shall be followed.\n\n\n\n\n6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All these tests may be conducted with the applicable market fuels. However, at the manufacturer's request, the reference fuels described in Annex IX shall be used. This implies tests, as described in Appendix 1 of Annex I, with at least two of the reference fuels for each gaseous-fuelled engine, except in the case of a gaseous-fuelled engine with a fuel-specific EU type-approval where only one reference fuel is required. Where more than one gaseous reference fuel is used the results shall demonstrate that the engine meets the limit values with each fuel.\n6.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non-compliance of gaseous-fuelled engines\nIn the case of dispute concerning compliance of gaseous-fuelled engines, including dual-fuel engines, when using a market fuel, the tests shall be performed with each reference fuel on which the parent engine has been tested, and, at the request of the manufacturer, with the possible additional third fuel, as referred to in points 2.3.1.1.1, 2.3.2.1 and 2.4.1.2 of Annex I, on which the parent engine may have been tested. When applicable, the result shall be converted by a calculation, applying the relevant factors \u2018r\u2019, \u2018r\na\u2019 or \u2018r\nb\u2019 as described in points 2.3.3, 2.3.4.1 and 2.4.1.3 of Annex I. If r, r\na or r\nb are less than 1, no correction shall take place. The measured results and, when applicable, the calculated results shall demonstrate that the engine meets the limit values with all relevant fuels (for example fuels 1, 2 and, if applicable, the third fuel in the case of natural gas\/bio-methane engines, and fuels A and B in the case of LPG engines).\n\nFigure 2.1\n\n\nSchematic of production conformity testing\n\n\n\nAppendix 1\n\nProcedure for

Rated speed for variable-speed engines subject to an emission test shall be determined from the applicable mapping procedure set out in section 7.6. Rated speed for constant-speed engines shall be declared by the manufacturer according to the characteristics of the governor. Where an engine type equipped with alternative speeds as permitted by Article 3(21) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628 is subject to an emission test, each alternative speed shall be declared and tested.\nIf the rated speed determined from the mapping procedure in section 7.6 is within \u00b1 150 rpm of the value declared by the manufacturer for engines of category NRS provided with governor, or within \u00b1 350 rpm or \u00b1 4 % for engines of category NRS without governor, whichever is smaller, or within \u00b1 100 rpm for all other engine categories, the declared value may be used. If the tolerance is exceeded, the rated speed determined from the mapping procedure shall be used.\nFor engines of category NRSh the 100 % test speed shall be within \u00b1 350 rpm of the rated speed.\nOptionally, MTS may be used instead of rated speed for any steady state test cycle.\n5.2.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maximum torque speed for variable-speed engines\nThe maximum torque speed determined from the maximum torque curve established from the applicable engine mapping procedure in point 7.6.1 or 7.6.2 shall be one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe speed at which the highest torque was recorded; or,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe average of the lowest and highest speeds at which the torque is equal to 98 % of the maximum torque. Where necessary, linear interpolation shall be used to determine the speeds at which the torque is equal to 98 % of the maximum torque.\n\n\n\n\nIf the maximum torque speed determined from the maximum torque curve is within \u00b1 4 % of the maximum torque speed declared by the manufacturer for engines of category NRS or NRSh, or \u00b1 2,5 % of the maximum torque speed declared by the manufacturer for all other engine categories, the declared value may be used for the purpose of this regulation. If the tolerance is exceeded, the maximum torque speed determined from the maximum torque curve shall be used.\n5.2.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intermediate speed\nThe intermediate speed shall meet one of the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nFor engines that are designed to operate over a speed range on a full load torque curve, the intermediate speed shall be the maximum torque speed if it occurs between 60 % and 75 % of rated speed;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nIf the maximum torque speed is less than 60 % of rated speed, then the intermediate speed shall be 60 % of the rated speed;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nIf the maximum torque speed is greater than 75 % of the rated speed then the intermediate speed shall be 75 % of rated speed. Where the engine is only capable of operation at speeds higher than 75 % of rated speed the intermediate speed shall be the lowest speed at which the engine can be operated;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nFor engines that are not designed to operate over a speed range on a full-load torque curve at steady-state conditions, the intermediate speed shall be between 60 % and 70 % of the rated speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nFor engines to be tested on cycle G1, except for engines of category ATS, the intermediate speed shall be 85 % of the rated speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nFor engines of category ATS tested on cycle G1 the intermediate speed shall be 60 % or 85 % of rated speed based on which is closer to the actual maximum torque speed.\n\n\n\n\nWhere the MTS is used in place of rated speed for the 100 % test speed, MTS shall also replace rated speed when determining the intermediate speed.\n5.2.5.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Idle speed\nThe idle speed is the lowest engine speed with minimum load (greater than or equal to zero load), where an engine governor function controls engine speed. For engines without a governor function that controls idle speed, idle speed means the manufacturer-declared value for lowest engine speed possible with minimum load. Note that warm idle speed is the idle speed of a warmed-up engine.\n5.2.5.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Test speed for constant-speed engines\nThe governors of constant-speed engines may not always maintain speed exactly constant. Typically speed can decrease (0,1 to 10) % below the speed at zero load, such that the minimum speed occurs near the engine's point of maximum power. The test speed for constant-speed engines may be commanded by using the governor installed on the engine or using a test-bed speed demand where this represents the engine governor.\nWhere the governor installed on the engine is used the 100 % speed shall be the engine governed speed as defined in Article 2(24).\nWhere a test-bed speed demand signal is used to simulate the governor, the 100 % speed at zero load shall be the no-load speed specified by the manufacturer for that governor setting and the 100 % speed at full load shall be the rated speed for that governor setting. Interpolation shall be used to determine the speed for the other test modes.\nWhere the governor has an isochronous operation setting, or the rated speed and no-load speed declared by the manufacturer differ by no more than 3 %, a single value declared by the manufacturer may be used for the 100 % speed at all load points.\n5.2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Torque and Power\n5.2.6.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Torque\nThe torque figures given in the test cycles are percentage values that represent, for a given test mode, one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe ratio of the required torque to the maximum possible torque at the specified test speed (all cycles except D2 & E2);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe ratio of the required torque to the torque corresponding to the rated net power declared by the manufacturer (cycle D2 & E2).\n\n\n\n\n5.2.6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Power\nThe power figures given in the test cycles are percentage values that represent, for a given test mode, one of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nFor the test cycle E3 the power figures are percentage values of the maximum net power at the 100 % speed as this cycle is based on a theoretical propeller characteristic curve for vessels driven by heavy-duty engines without limitation of length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFor the test cycle F the power figures are percentage values of the maximum net power at the given test speed, except for idle speed where it is a percentage of the maximum net power at the 100 % speed.\n\n\n\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Test Conditions\n\n6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laboratory test conditions\nThe absolute temperature (T\na) of the engine air at the inlet to the engine expressed in Kelvin, and the dry atmospheric pressure (p\ns), expressed in kPa shall be measured and the parameter f\na shall be determined in accordance with the following provisions and by means of equation (6-5) or (6-6). If the atmospheric pressure is measured in a duct, negligible pressure losses shall be ensured between the atmosphere and the measurement location, and changes in the duct's static pressure resulting from the flow shall be accounted for. In multi-cylinder engines having distinct groups of intake manifolds, such as in a \u2018V\u2019 engine configuration, the average temperature of the distinct groups shall be taken. The parameter fa shall be reported with the test results.\nNaturally aspirated and mechanically supercharged engines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6-5)\n\n\n\n\nTurbocharged engines with or without cooling of the intake air:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6-6)\n\n\n\n\n6.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the test to be considered valid both the following conditions must be met:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\nf\na shall be within the range 0,93 \u2264 f\na \u2264 1,07 except as permitted by points 6.1.2 and 6.1.4;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe temperature of intake air shall be maintained to 298 \u00b1 5 K (25 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C), measured upstream of any engine component, except as permitted by points 6.1.3 and 6.1.4, and as required by points 6.1.5 and 6.1.6.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the altitude of the laboratory in which the engine is being tested exceeds 600 m, with the agreement of the manufacturer f\na may exceed 1,07 on the condition that p\ns shall not be less than 80 kPa.\n6.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the power of the engine being tested is greater than 560 kW, with the agreement of the manufacturer the maximum value of intake air temperature may exceed 303 K (30 \u00b0C) on the condition that it shall not exceed 308 K (35 \u00b0C).\n6.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the altitude of the laboratory in which the engine is being tested exceeds 300 m and the power of the engine being tested is greater than 560 kW, with the agreement of the manufacturer f\na may exceed 1,07 on the condition that p\ns shall not be less than 80 kPa and the maximum value of intake air temperature may exceed 303 K (30 \u00b0C) on the condition that it shall not exceed 308 K (35 \u00b0C).\n6.1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case of an engine family of category NRS less than 19 kW exclusively consisting of engine types to be used in snow throwers, the temperature of the intake air shall be maintained between 273 K and 268 K (0 \u00b0C and \u2013 5 \u00b0C).\n6.1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For engines of category SMB the temperature of the intake air shall be maintained to 263 \u00b1 5 K (\u2013 10 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C), except as permitted by point 6.1.6.1.\n6.1.6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For engines of category SMB fitted with electronically controlled fuel injection that adjusts the fuel flow to the intake air temperature, at the choice of the manufacturer the temperature of the intake air may alternatively be maintained to 298 \u00b1 5 K (25 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C).\n6.1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is allowed to use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nan atmospheric pressure meter whose output is used as the atmospheric pressure for an entire test facility that has more than one dynamometer test cell, as long as the equipment for handling intake air maintains ambient pressure, where the engine is tested, within \u00b1 1 kPa of the shared atmospheric pressure;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nA humidity measurement device to measure the humidity of intake air for an entire test facility that has more than one dynamometer test cell, as long as the equipment for handling intake air maintains dew point, where the engine is tested, within \u00b1 0,5 K of the shared humidity measurement.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engines with charge-air cooling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nA charge-air cooling system with a total intake-air capacity that represents production engines' in-use installation shall be used. Any laboratory charge-air cooling system to minimize accumulation of condensate shall be designed. Any accumulated condensate shall be drained and all drains shall be completely closed before emission testing. The drains shall be kept closed during the emission test. Coolant conditions shall be maintained as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\na coolant temperature of at least 20 \u00b0C shall be maintained at the inlet to the charge-air cooler throughout testing;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nat the rated speed and full load, the coolant flow rate shall be set to achieve an air temperature within \u00b1 5 \u00b0C of the value designed by the manufacturer after the charge-air cooler's outlet.

The pressure drop shall be measured at the manufacturer's specified locations;\n\n\n\n\nWhen the MTS defined in point 5.2.5.1 is being used in place of rated speed to run the test cycle then this speed may be used in place of rated speed when setting the charge air temperature.\nThe objective is to produce emission results that are representative of in-use operation. If good engineering judgment indicates that the specifications in this section would result in unrepresentative testing (such as overcooling of the intake air), more sophisticated set points and controls of charge-air pressure drop, coolant temperature, and flow rate may be used to achieve more representative results.\n\n\n\n\n6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine power\n6.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Basis for emission measurement\nThe basis of specific emissions measurement is uncorrected net power as defined in Article 3(23) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628.\n6.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Auxiliaries to be fitted\nDuring the test, the auxiliaries necessary for the engine operation shall be installed on the test bench according to the requirements of Appendix 2.\nWhere the necessary auxiliaries cannot be fitted for the test, the power they absorb shall be determined and subtracted from the measured engine power.\n6.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Auxiliaries to be removed\nCertain auxiliaries whose definition is linked with the operation of the non-road mobile machinery and which may be mounted on the engine shall be removed for the test.\nWhere auxiliaries cannot be removed, the power they absorb in the unloaded condition may be determined and added to the measured engine power (see note g in Appendix 2). If this value is greater than 3 % of the maximum power at the test speed it may be verified by the technical service. The power absorbed by auxiliaries shall be used to adjust the set values and to calculate the work produced by the engine over the test cycle in accordance with point 7.7.1.3 or point 7.7.2.3.1.\n6.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determination of auxiliary power\nThe power absorbed by the auxiliaries\/equipment needs only be determined, if:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nAuxiliaries\/equipment required according to Appendix 2, are not fitted to the engine;\nand\/or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nAuxiliaries\/equipment not required according to Appendix 2, are fitted to the engine.\n\n\n\n\nThe values of auxiliary power and the measurement\/calculation method for determining auxiliary power shall be submitted by the engine manufacturer for the whole operating area of the applicable test cycles, and approved by the approval authority.\n6.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine cycle work\nThe calculation of reference and actual cycle work (see point 7.8.3.4) shall be based upon engine power in accordance with point 6.3.1. In this case, P\nf and P\nr of equation (6-7) are zero, and P equals P\nm.\nIf auxiliaries\/equipment are installed in accordance with points 6.3.2 and\/or 6.3.3, the power absorbed by them shall be used to correct each instantaneous cycle power value P\nm,i, by means of equation (6-8):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\ni = P\nm,i \u2013 P\nf,i + P\nr,i\n\n\n\n(6-7)\n\n\n\n\n\nP\nAUX = P\nr,i \u2013 P\nf,i\n\n\n\n(6-8)\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP\nm,i\n\n\n\nis the measured engine power, kW\n\n\n\n\n\nP\nf,i\n\n\n\nis the power absorbed by auxiliaries\/equipment to be fitted for the test but that were not installed, kW\n\n\n\n\n\nP\nr,i\n\n\n\nis the power absorbed by auxiliaries\/equipment to be removed for the test but that were installed, kW.\n\n\n\n\n6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine intake air\n6.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction\nThe intake-air system installed on the engine or one that represents a typical in-use configuration shall be used. This includes the charge-air cooling and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR).\n6.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intake air pressure restriction\nAn engine air intake system or a test laboratory system shall be used presenting an intake air pressure restriction within \u00b1 300 Pa of the maximum value specified by the manufacturer for a clean air cleaner at the rated speed and full load. Where this is not possible due to the design of the test laboratory air supply system a pressure restriction not exceeding the value specified by the manufacturer for a dirty filter shall be permitted subject to prior approval of the technical service. The static differential pressure of the pressure restriction shall be measured at the location and at the speed and torque set points specified by the manufacturer. If the manufacturer does not specify a location, this pressure shall be measured upstream of any turbocharger or exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) connection to the intake air system.\nWhen the MTS defined in point 5.2.5.1 is being used in place of rated speed to run the test cycle then this speed may be used in place of rated speed when setting the intake air pressure restriction.\n6.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine exhaust system\nThe exhaust system installed with the engine or one that represents a typical in-use configuration shall be used. The exhaust system shall conform to the requirements for exhaust emissions sampling, as set out in point 9.3. An engine exhaust system or a test laboratory system shall be used presenting a static exhaust gas back-pressure within 80 to 100 % of the maximum exhaust gas pressure restriction at the rated speed and full load. The exhaust gas pressure restriction may be set using a valve. If the maximum exhaust gas pressure restriction is 5 kPa or less, the set point shall not be more than 1,0 kPa from the maximum. When the MTS defined in point 5.2.5.1 is being used in place of rated speed to run the test cycle then this speed may be used in place of rated speed when setting the exhaust gas pressure restriction.\n6.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine with exhaust after-treatment system\nIf the engine is equipped with an exhaust after-treatment system that is not mounted directly on the engine, the exhaust pipe shall have the same diameter as found in-use for at least four pipe diameters upstream of the expansion section containing the after-treatment device. The distance from the exhaust manifold flange or turbocharger outlet to the exhaust after-treatment system shall be the same as in the non-road mobile machinery configuration or within the distance specifications of the manufacturer. Where specified by the manufacturer the pipe shall be insulated to achieve an after-treatment inlet temperature within the specification of the manufacturer. Where other installation requirements are specified by the manufacturer these shall also be respected for the test configuration. The exhaust gas back-pressure or pressure restriction shall be set according to point 6.5. For exhaust after-treatment devices with variable exhaust gas pressure restriction, the maximum exhaust gas pressure restriction used in point 6.5 is defined at the after-treatment condition (degreening\/ageing and regeneration\/loading level) specified by the manufacturer. The after-treatment container may be removed during dummy tests and during engine mapping, and replaced with an equivalent container having an inactive catalyst support.\nThe emissions measured on the test cycle shall be representative of the emissions in the field. In the case of an engine equipped with an exhaust after-treatment system that requires the consumption of a reagent, the reagent used for all tests shall be declared by the manufacturer.\nFor engines of category NRE, NRG, IWP, IWA, RLR, NRS, NRSh, SMB, and ATS equipped with exhaust after-treatment systems that are regenerated on an infrequent (periodic) basis, as described in point 6.6.2, emission results shall be adjusted to account for regeneration events. In this case, the average emission depends on the frequency of the regeneration event in terms of fraction of tests during which the regeneration occurs. After-treatment systems with a regeneration process that occurs either in a sustained manner or at least once over the applicable transient (NRTC or LSI-NRTC) test cycle or RMC (\u2018continuous regeneration\u2019) in accordance with point 6.6.1 do not require a special test procedure.\n6.6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Continuous regeneration\nFor an exhaust after-treatment system based on a continuous regeneration process the emissions shall be measured on an after-treatment system that has been stabilized so as to result in repeatable emissions behaviour. The regeneration process shall occur at least once during the hot-start NRTC, LSI-NRTC or NRSC test, and the manufacturer shall declare the normal conditions under which regeneration occurs (soot load, temperature, exhaust gas back-pressure, etc.). In order to demonstrate that the regeneration process is continuous, at least three hot-start runs of the NRTC, LSI-NRTC or NRSC shall be conducted. In case of hot-start NRTC, the engine shall be warmed up in accordance with point 7.8.2.1, the engine be soaked according to point 7.4.2.1(b) and the first hot-start NRTC.\nThe subsequent hot-start NRTC shall be started after soaking according with point 7.4.2.1(b). During the tests, exhaust gas temperatures and pressures shall be recorded (temperature before and after the exhaust after-treatment system, exhaust gas back-pressure, etc.). The exhaust after-treatment system is considered to be satisfactory if the conditions declared by the manufacturer occur during the test within a sufficient time and the emission results do not scatter by more than \u00b1 25 % from the mean value or 0,005 g\/kWh, whichever is greater.\n6.6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Infrequent regeneration\nThis provision only applies to engines equipped with an exhaust after-treatment system that is regenerated on an infrequent basis, typically occurring in less than 100 hours of normal engine operation. For those engines, either additive or multiplicative factors shall be determined for upward and downward adjustment as referred to in point 6.6.2.4 (\u2018adjustment factor\u2019).\nTesting and development of adjustment factors is only required for one applicable transient (NRTC or LSI-NRTC) test cycle or RMC. The factors that have been developed may be applied to results from the other applicable test cycles including discrete-mode NRSC.\nIn case that no suitable adjustment factors are available from testing using transient (NRTC or LSI-NRTC) test cycle or RMC then adjustment factors shall be established using an applicable discrete-mode NRSC test. Factors developed using a discrete-mode NRSC test shall only be applied to discrete-mode NRSC.\nIt shall not be required to conduct testing and develop adjustment factors on both RMC and discrete-mode NRSC.\n6.6.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Requirement for establishing adjustment factors using NRTC, LSI-NRTC or RMC\nThe emissions shall be measured on at least three hot-start runs of the NRTC, LSI-NRTC or RMC, one with and two without a regeneration event on a stabilized exhaust after-treatment system. The regeneration process shall occur at least once during the NRTC, LSI-NRTC or RMC with a regeneration event. If regeneration takes longer than one NRTC, LSI-NRTC or RMC, consecutive NRTC, LSI-NRTC or RMC shall be run and emissions continued to be measured without shutting the engine off until regeneration is completed and the average of the tests shall be calculated. If regeneration is completed during any test, the test shall be continued over its entire length.\nAn appropriate adjustment factor shall be determined for the entire applicable cycle by means of equations (6-10) to (6-13).\n6.6.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Requirement for establishing adjustment factors using discrete-mode NRSC testing\nStarting with a stabilized exhaust after-treatment system the emissions shall be measured on at least three runs of each test mode of the applicable discrete-mode NRSC on which the conditions for regeneration can be met, one with and two without a regeneration event. The measurement of PM shall be conducted using the multiple filter method described in point 7.8.1.2(c). If regeneration has started but is not complete at the end of the sampling period for a specific test mode extend the sampling period shall be extended until regeneration is complete. Where there are multiple runs for the same mode an average result shall be calculated. The process shall be repeated for each test mode.\nAn appropriate adjustment factor shall be determined by means of equations (6-10) to (6-13) for those modes of the applicable cycle for which regeneration occurs.\n6.6.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General procedure for developing infrequent regeneration adjustment factors (IRAFs)\nThe manufacturer shall declare the normal parameter conditions under which the regeneration process occurs (soot load, temperature, exhaust gas back-pressure, etc.). The manufacturer shall also provide the frequency of the regeneration event in terms of number of tests during which the regeneration occurs. The exact procedure to determine this frequency shall be agreed by the type approval or certification authority based upon good engineering judgement.\nFor a regeneration test, the manufacturer shall provide an exhaust after-treatment system that has been loaded. Regeneration shall not occur during this engine conditioning phase. As an option, the manufacturer may run consecutive tests of the applicable cycle until the exhaust after-treatment system is loaded. Emissions measurement is not required on all tests.\nAverage emissions between regeneration phases shall be determined from the arithmetic mean of several approximately equidistant tests of the applicable cycle. As a minimum, at least one applicable cycle as close as possible prior to a regeneration test and one applicable cycle immediately after a regeneration test shall be conducted.\nDuring the regeneration test, all the data needed to detect regeneration shall be recorded (CO or NOx emissions, temperature before and after the exhaust after-treatment system, exhaust gas back-pressure, etc.). During the regeneration process, the applicable emission limits may be exceeded. The test procedure is schematically shown in Figure 6.1.\n\nFigure 6.1\n\n\nScheme of infrequent (periodic) regeneration with n number of measurements and n\nr number of measurements during regeneration.\n\n\n\n\nThe average specific emission rate related to the test runs conducted according to points 6.6.2.1 or 6.6.2.2 [g\/kWh or #\/kWh] shall be weighted by means of equation (6-9) (see Figure 6.1):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6-9)\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\nis the number of tests in which regeneration does not occur,\n\n\n\n\n\nn\nr\n\n\n\nis the number of tests in which regeneration occurs (minimum one test),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis the average specific emission from a test in which the regeneration does not occur [g\/kWh or #\/kWh]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis the average specific emission from a test in which the regeneration occurs [g\/kWh or #\/kWh]\n\n\n\n\nAt the choice of the manufacturer and based on upon good engineering judgment, the regeneration adjustment factor k\nr, expressing the average emission rate, may be calculated either multiplicative or additive for all gaseous pollutants, and, where there is an applicable limit, for PM and PN, by means of equations (6-10) to (6-13):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMultiplicative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(upward adjustment factor)\n\n\n(6-10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(downward adjustment factor)\n\n\n(6-11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\nru,a = e\nw \u2013 e\n\n\n\n(upward adjustment factor)\n\n\n(6-12)\n\n\n\n\n\nk\nrd,a = e\nw \u2013 e\nr\n\n\n\n(downward adjustment factor)\n\n\n(6-13)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Application of adjustment factors\nUpward adjustment factors are multiplied with or added to measured emission rates for all tests in which the regeneration does not occur. Downward adjustment factors are multiplied with or added to measured emission rates for all tests in which the regeneration occurs. The occurrence of the regeneration shall be identified in a manner that is readily apparent during all testing. Where no regeneration is identified, the upward adjustment factor shall be applied.\nWith reference to Annex VII and Appendix 5 of Annex VII on brake specific emission calculations, the regeneration adjustment factor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nWhen established for an entire weighted cycle, shall be applied to the results of the applicable weighted NRTC, LSI-NRTC and NRSC;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nWhen established specifically for the individual modes of the applicable discrete-mode NRSC, shall be applied to the results of those modes of the applicable discrete-mode NRSC for which regeneration occurs prior to calculating the cycle weighted emission result.

In these cases, no adjustment factor shall be used, and the manufacturer is liable for compliance with the emission limits for all tests, without regard to whether a regeneration occurs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nUpon request by the manufacturer, the approval authority may account for regeneration events differently than is provided in paragraph (a). However, this option only applies to events that occur extremely infrequently, and which cannot be practically addressed using the adjustment factors described in paragraph (a).\n\n\n\n\n6.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cooling system\nAn engine cooling system with sufficient capacity to maintain the engine, with its intake-air, oil, coolant, block and head temperatures, at normal operating temperatures prescribed by the manufacturer shall be used. Laboratory auxiliary coolers and fans may be used.\n6.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lubricating oil\nThe lubricating oil shall be specified by the manufacturer and be representative of lubricating oil available in the market; the specifications of the lubricating oil used for the test shall be recorded and presented with the results of the test.\n6.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specification of the reference fuel\nThe reference fuels to be used for the test are specified in Annex IX.\nThe fuel temperature shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The fuel temperature shall be measured at the inlet to the fuel injection pump or as specified by the manufacturer, and the location of measurement recorded.\n6.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crankcase emissions\nThis section shall apply to engines of category NRE, NRG, IWP, IWA, RLR, NRS, NRSh, SMB, & ATS complying with Stage V emission limits set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628.\nCrankcase emissions that are discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere shall be added to the exhaust emissions (either physically or mathematically) during all emission testing.\nManufacturers taking advantage of this exception shall install the engines so that all crankcase emission can be routed into the emissions sampling system. For the purpose of this point, crankcase emissions that are routed into the exhaust gas upstream of exhaust after-treatment system during all operation are not considered to be discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere.\nOpen crankcase emissions shall be routed into the exhaust system for emission measurement, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe tubing materials shall be smooth-walled, electrically conductive, and not reactive with crankcase emissions. Tube lengths shall be minimized as far as possible;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe number of bends in the laboratory crankcase tubing shall be minimized, and the radius of any unavoidable bend shall be maximized;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nThe laboratory crankcase exhaust tubing shall meet the engine manufacturer's specifications for crankcase back-pressure;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nThe crankcase exhaust tubing shall connect into the raw exhaust gas downstream of any exhaust after-treatment system, downstream of any installed exhaust emissions restriction, and sufficiently upstream of any sample probes to ensure complete mixing with the engine's exhaust system before sampling.

The crankcase exhaust tube's outlet may orient in any direction relative to the raw exhaust gas flow.\n\n\n\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Test procedures\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction\nThis chapter describes the determination of brake specific emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants on engines to be tested. The test engine shall be the parent engine configuration for the engine family as specified Annex IX to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017\/656.\nA laboratory emission test consists of measuring emissions and other parameters for the test cycles specified in Annex XVII. The following aspects are treated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe laboratory configurations for measuring the emissions (point 7.2);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe pre-test and post-test verification procedures (point 7.3);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nThe test cycles (point 7.4);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nThe general test sequence (point 7.5);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nThe engine mapping (point 7.6);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nThe test cycle generation (point 7.7);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nThe specific test cycle running procedure (point 7.8).\n\n\n\n\n7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Principle of emission measurement\nTo measure the brake-specific emissions, the engine shall be operated over the test cycles defined in point 7.4, as applicable. The measurement of brake-specific emissions requires the determination of the mass of pollutants in the exhaust emissions (i.e. HC, CO, NOx and PM), the number of particulates in the exhaust emissions (i.e. PN), the mass of CO2 in the exhaust emissions, and the corresponding engine work.\n7.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mass of constituent\nThe total mass of each constituent shall be determined over the applicable test cycle by using the following methods:\n7.2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Continuous sampling\nIn continuous sampling, the constituent's concentration is measured continuously from raw or diluted exhaust gas. This concentration is multiplied by the continuous (raw or diluted) exhaust gas flow rate at the emission sampling location to determine the constituent's flow rate. The constituent's emission is continuously summed over the test interval. This sum is the total mass of the emitted constituent.\n7.2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Batch sampling\nIn batch sampling, a sample of raw or diluted exhaust gas is continuously extracted and stored for later measurement. The extracted sample shall be proportional to the raw or diluted exhaust gas flow rate. Examples of batch sampling are collecting diluted gaseous emissions in a bag and collecting PM on a filter. In principal the method of emission calculation is done as follows: the batch sampled concentrations are multiplied by the total mass or mass flow (raw or dilute) from which it was extracted during the test cycle. This product is the total mass or mass flow of the emitted constituent. To calculate the PM concentration, the PM deposited onto a filter from proportionally extracted exhaust gas shall be divided by the amount of filtered exhaust gas.\n7.2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Combined sampling\nAny combination of continuous and batch sampling is permitted (e.g. PM with batch sampling and gaseous emissions with continuous sampling).\nFigure 6.2 illustrates the two aspects of the test procedures for measuring emissions: the equipment with the sampling lines in raw and diluted exhaust gas and the operations requested to calculate the pollutant emissions in steady-state and transient test cycles.\n\nFigure 6.2\n\n\nTest procedures for emission measurement\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Work determination\nThe work shall be determined over the test cycle by synchronously multiplying speed and brake torque to calculate instantaneous values for engine brake power. Engine brake power shall be integrated over the test cycle to determine total work.\n7.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verification and calibration\n7.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pre-test procedures\n7.3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preconditioning\nTo achieve stable conditions, the sampling system and the engine shall be preconditioned before starting a test sequence as specified in this point.\nThe intent of engine preconditioning is to achieve the representativeness of emissions and emission controls over the duty cycle and to reduce bias in order to meet stable conditions for the following emission test.\nEmissions may be measured during preconditioning cycles, as long as a predefined number of preconditioning cycles are performed and the measurement system has been started according to the requirements of point 7.3.1.4. The amount of preconditioning shall be identified by the engine manufacturer before starting to precondition. Preconditioning shall be performed as follows, noting that the specific cycles for preconditioning are the same ones that apply for emission testing.\n7.3.1.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preconditioning for cold-start run of NRTC\nThe engine shall be preconditioned by running at least one hot-start NRTC. Immediately after completing each preconditioning cycle, the engine shall be shut down and the engine-off hot-soak period shall be completed. Immediately after completing the last preconditioning cycle, the engine shall be shut down and the engine cool down described in point 7.3.1.2 shall be started.\n7.3.1.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preconditioning for hot-start run of NRTC or for LSI-NRTC\nThis point describes the pre-conditioning that shall be applied when it is intended to sample emissions from the hot-start NRTC without running the cold-start run of the NRTC (\u2018cold-start NRTC\u2019), or for the LSI-NRTC. The engine shall be preconditioned by running at least one hot-start NRTC or LSI-NRTC as applicable. Immediately after completing each preconditioning cycle, the engine shall be shut down, and then the next cycle shall be started as soon as practical. It is recommended that the next preconditioning cycle shall be started within 60 seconds after completing the last preconditioning cycle. Where applicable, following the last pre-conditioning cycle the appropriate hot-soak (hot-start NRTC) or cool-down (LSI-NRTC) period shall apply before the engine is started for the emissions test. Where no hot-soak or cool down period applies it is recommended that the emissions test shall be started within 60 seconds after completing the last pre-conditioning cycle.\n7.3.1.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preconditioning for discrete-mode NRSC\nFor engine categories other than NRS and NRSh the engine shall be warmed-up and run until engine temperatures (cooling water and lube oil) have been stabilized on 50 % speed and 50 % torque for any discrete-mode NRSC test cycle other than type D2, E2, or G, or nominal engine speed and 50 % torque for any discrete-mode NRSC test cycle D2, E2 or G. The 50 % speed shall be calculated in accordance with point 5.2.5.1 in the case of an engine where MTS is used for the generation of test speeds, and calculated in accordance with point 7.7.1.3 in all other cases. 50 % torque is defined as 50 % of the maximum available torque at this speed. The emissions test shall be started without stopping the engine.\nFor engine categories NRS and NRSh the engine shall be warmed up according to the recommendation of the manufacturer and good engineering judgment. Before emission sampling can start, the engine shall be running on mode 1 of the appropriate test cycle until engine temperatures have been stabilized. The emissions test shall be started without stopping the engine.\n7.3.1.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preconditioning for RMC\nThe engine manufacturer shall select one of the following pre-conditioning sequences (a) or (b). The engine shall be pre-conditioned according to the chosen sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe engine shall be preconditioned by running at least the second half of the RMC, based on the number of test modes. The engine shall not be shut down between cycles. Immediately after completing each preconditioning cycle, the next cycle (including the emission test) shall be started as soon as practical. Where possible, it is recommended that the next cycle be started within 60 seconds after completing the last preconditioning cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe engine shall be warmed-up and run until engine temperatures (cooling water and lube oil) have been stabilized on 50 % speed and 50 % torque for any RMC test cycle other than type D2, E2, or G, or nominal engine speed and 50 % torque for any RMC test cycle D2, E2 or G. The 50 % speed shall be calculated in accordance with point 5.2.5.1 in the case of an engine where MTS is used for the generation of test speeds, and be calculated in accordance with point 7.7.1.3 in all other cases. 50 % torque is defined as 50 % of the maximum available torque at this speed.\n\n\n\n\n7.3.1.1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine cool-down (NRTC)\nA natural or forced cool-down procedure may be applied. For forced cool-down, good engineering judgment shall be used to set up systems to send cooling air across the engine, to send cool oil through the engine lubrication system, to remove heat from the coolant through the engine cooling system, and to remove heat from an exhaust after-treatment system. In the case of a forced after-treatment cool down, cooling air shall not be applied until the exhaust after-treatment system has cooled below its catalytic activation temperature. Any cooling procedure that results in unrepresentative emissions is not permitted.\n7.3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verification of HC contamination\nIf there is any presumption of an essential HC contamination of the exhaust gas measuring system, the contamination with HC may be checked with zero gas and the hang-up may then be corrected. If the amount of contamination of the measuring system and the background HC system has to be checked, it shall be conducted within 8 hours of starting each test-cycle. The values shall be recorded for later correction. Before this check, the leak check has to be performed and the FID analyzer has to be calibrated.\n7.3.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Preparation of measurement equipment for sampling\nThe following steps shall be taken before emission sampling begins:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nLeak checks shall be performed within 8 hours prior to emission sampling according to point 8.1.8.7;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFor batch sampling, clean storage media shall be connected, such as evacuated bags or tare-weighed filters;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nAll measurement instruments shall be started according to the instrument manufacturer's instructions and good engineering judgment;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nDilution systems, sample pumps, cooling fans, and the data-collection system shall be started;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nThe sample flow rates shall be adjusted to desired levels, using bypass flow, if desired;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nHeat exchangers in the sampling system shall be pre-heated or pre-cooled to within their operating temperature ranges for a test;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nHeated or cooled components such as sample lines, filters, chillers, and pumps shall be allowed to stabilize at their operating temperatures;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h)\n\n\nExhaust gas dilution system flow shall be switched on at least 10 minutes before a test sequence;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nCalibration of gas analyzers and zeroing of continuous analyzers shall be carried out according to the procedure of the next point 7.3.1.4;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(j)\n\n\nAny electronic integrating devices shall be zeroed or re-zeroed, before the start of any test interval.\n\n\n\n\n7.3.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calibration of gas analyzers\nAppropriate gas analyzer ranges shall be selected. Emission analyzers with automatic or manual range switching are allowed. During a test using transient (NRTC or LSI-NRTC) test cycles or RMC and during a sampling period of a gaseous emission at the end of each mode for discrete-mode NRSC testing, the range of the emission analyzers may not be switched. Also the gains of an analyzer's analogue operational amplifier(s) may not be switched during a test cycle.\nAll continuous analyzers shall be zeroed and spanned using internationally-traceable gases that meet the specifications of point 9.5.1. FID analyzers shall be spanned on a carbon number basis of one (C1).\n7.3.1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PM filter preconditioning and tare weighing\nThe procedures for PM filter preconditioning and tare weighing shall be followed according to point 8.2.3.\n7.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Post-test procedures\nThe following steps shall be taken after emission sampling is complete:\n7.3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verification of proportional sampling\nFor any proportional batch sample, such as a bag sample or PM sample, it shall be verified that proportional sampling was maintained according to point 8.2.1. For the single filter method and the discrete steady-state test cycle, effective PM weighting factor shall be calculated. Any sample that does not fulfil the requirements of point 8.2.1 shall be voided.\n7.3.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Post-test PM conditioning and weighing\nUsed PM sample filters shall be placed into covered or sealed containers or the filter holders shall be closed, in order to protect the sample filters against ambient contamination. Thus protected, the loaded filters have to be returned to the PM-filter conditioning chamber or room. Then the PM sample filters shall be conditioned and weighted accordingly to point 8.2.4 (PM filter post-conditioning and total weighing procedures).\n7.3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analysis of gaseous batch sampling\nAs soon as practical, the following shall be performed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nAll batch gas analyzers shall be zeroed and spanned no later than 30 minutes after the test cycle is complete or during the soak period if practical to check if gaseous analyzers are still stable;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nAny conventional gaseous batch samples shall be analyzed no later than 30 minutes after the hot-start NRTC is complete or during the soak period;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nThe background samples shall be analyzed no later than 60 minutes after the hot-start NRTC is complete.\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drift verification\nAfter quantifying exhaust gas, drift shall be verified as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nFor batch and continuous gas analyzers, the mean analyzer value shall be recorded after stabilizing a zero gas to the analyzer. Stabilization may include time to purge the analyzer of any sample gas, plus any additional time to account for analyzer response;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe mean analyzer value shall be recorded after stabilizing the span gas to the analyzer. Stabilization may include time to purge the analyzer of any sample gas, plus any additional time to account for analyzer response;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nThese data shall be used to validate and correct for drift as described in point 8.2.2.\n\n\n\n\n7.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Test cycles\nThe EU type-approval test shall be conducted using the appropriate NRSC and, where applicable, NRTC or LSI-NRTC, specified in Article 23 and Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628. The technical specifications and characteristics of the NRSC, NRTC and LSI-NRTC are laid down in Annex XVII and the method for determination of the load and speed settings for these test cycles set out in section 5.2.\n7.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Steady-state test cycles\nNon-road steady-state test cycles (NRSC) are specified in Appendices 1 and 2 of Annex XVII as a list of discrete-modes NRSC (operating points), where each operating point has one value of speed and one value of torque. A NRSC shall be measured with a warmed up and running engine according to manufacturer's specification. At the choice of the manufacturer, a NRSC may be run as a discrete-mode NRSC or a RMC, as explained in points 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2. It shall not be required to conduct an emission test according to both points 7.4.1.1 and 7.4.1.2.\n7.4.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discrete-mode NRSC\nThe discrete-mode NRSC are hot running cycles where emissions shall be started to be measured after the engine is started, warmed up and running as specified in point 7.8.1.2. Each cycle consists of a number of speed and load modes (with the respective weighing factor for each mode) which cover the typical operating range of the specified engine category.\n7.4.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ramped modal NRSC\nThe RMC are hot running cycles where emissions shall be started to be measured after the engine is started, warmed up and running as specified in point 7.8.2.1. The engine shall be continuously controlled by the test bed control unit during the RMC. The gaseous and particulate emissions shall be measured and sampled continuously during the RMC in the same way as in a transient (NRTC or LSI-NRTC) test cycles.\nAn RMC is intended to provide a method for performing a steady-state test in a pseudo-transient manner. Each RMC consists of a series of steady state modes with a linear transition between them. The relative total time at each mode and its preceding transition match the weighting of the discrete-mode NRSC. The change in engine speed and load from one mode to the next one has to be linearly controlled in a time of 20 \u00b1 1 seconds. The mode change time is part of the new mode (including the first mode). In some cases modes are not run in the same order as the discrete-mode NRSC or are split to prevent extreme changes in temperature.\n7.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transient (NRTC and LSI-NRTC) test cycles\nThe non-road transient cycle for engines of category NRE (NRTC) and the non-road transient cycle for large spark ignition engines of category NRS (LSI-NRTC) are each specified in Appendix 3 of Annex XVII as a second-by-second sequence of normalized speed and torque values. In order to perform the test in an engine test cell, the normalized values shall be converted to their equivalent reference values for the individual engine to be tested, based on specific speed and torque values identified in the engine-mapping curve. The conversion is referred to as denormalization, and the resulting test cycle is the reference NRTC or LSI-NRTC test cycle of the engine to be tested (see point 7.7.2).\n7.4.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Test sequence for NRTC\nA graphical display of the normalized NRTC dynamometer schedule is shown in Figure 6.3.\n\nFigure 6.3\n\n\nNRTC normalized dynamometer schedule\n\n\n\n\nThe NRTC shall be run twice after completion of pre-conditioning (see point 7.3.1.1.1) in accordance with the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nthe cold start after the engine and exhaust after-treatment systems have cooled down to room temperature after natural engine cool down, or the cold start after forced cool down and the engine, coolant and oil temperatures, exhaust after-treatment systems and all engine control devices are stabilized between 293 K and 303 K (20 \u00b0C and 30\u00a0\u00b0C). The measurement of the cold start emissions shall be started with the start of the cold engine;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nthe hot soak period shall commence immediately upon completion of the cold start phase. The engine shall be shut-down and conditioned for the hot-start run by soaking it for 20 minutes \u00b1 1 minute;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nthe hot-start run shall be started immediately after the soak period with the cranking of the engine. The gaseous analyzers shall be switched on at least 10 seconds before the end of the soak period to avoid switching signal peaks. The measurement of emissions shall be started in parallel with the start of the hot-start NRTC, including the cranking of the engine.\n\n\n\n\nBrake specific emissions expressed in (g\/kWh) shall be determined by using the procedures set out in this section for both the cold-start and hot-start NRTC. Composite weighted emissions shall be computed by weighting the cold-start run results by 10 % and the hot-start run results by 90 % as detailed in Annex VII.\n7.4.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Test sequence for LSI-NRTC\nThe LSI-NRTC shall be run once as a hot-start run after completion of pre-conditioning (see point 7.3.1.1.2) in accordance with the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nthe engine shall be started and operated for the first 180 seconds of the duty cycle, then operated at idle without load for 30 seconds. Emissions shall not be measured during this warm-up sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nAt the end of the 30-second idling period, emissions measurement shall be started and the engine be operated over the entire duty cycle from the beginning (time 0 sec).\n\n\n\n\nBrake specific emissions expressed in (g\/kWh) shall be determined by using the procedures of Annex VII.\nIf the engine was already operating before the test, use good engineering judgment to let the engine cool down enough so measured emissions will accurately represent those from an engine starting at room temperature. For example, if an engine starting at room temperature warms up enough in three minutes to start closed-loop operation and achieve full catalyst activity, then minimal engine cooling is necessary before starting the next test.\nWith the prior agreement of the technical service, the engine warm-up procedure may include up to 15 minutes of operation over the duty cycle.\n7.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General test sequence\nTo measure engine emissions the following steps have to be performed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe engine test speeds and test loads have to be defined for the engine to be tested by measuring the max torque (for constant-speed engines) or max torque curve (for variable-speed engines) as function of the engine speed;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nNormalized test cycles have to be denormalized with the torque (for constant-speed engines) or speeds and torques (for variable-speed engines) found in the previous point 7.5(a);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nThe engine, equipment, and measurement instruments shall be prepared for the following emission test or test series (cold-start run and hot-start run) in advance;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nPre-test procedures shall be performed to verify proper operation of certain equipment and analyzers. All analysers have to be calibrated. All pre-test data shall be recorded;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nThe engine shall be started (NRTC) or kept running (steady-state cycles and LSI-NRTC) at the beginning of the test cycle and the sampling systems shall be started at the same time;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nEmissions and other required parameters shall be measured or recorded during sampling time (for NRTC, LSI-NRTC and RMC throughout the whole test cycle);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nPost-test procedures shall be performed to verify proper operation of certain equipment and analyzers;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h)\n\n\nPM filter(s) shall be pre-conditioned, weighed (empty weight), loaded, re-conditioned, again weighed (loaded weight) and then samples shall be evaluated according to pre- (para. 7.3.1.5) and post-test (para. 7.3.2.2) procedures;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nEmission test results shall be evaluated.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4 gives an overview about the procedures needed to conduct NRMM test cycles with measuring exhaust engine emissions.\n\nFigure 6.4\n\n\nTest sequence\n\n\n\n\n7.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine starting, and restarting\n7.5.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine start\nThe engine shall be started:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nAs recommended in the end-users' instructions using a production starter motor or air-start system and either an adequately charged battery, a suitable power supply or a suitable compressed air source; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nBy using the dynamometer to crank the engine until it starts. Typically operate the engine within \u00b1 25 % of its typical in-use cranking speed or start the engine by linearly increasing the dynamometer speed from zero to 100 min\u2013\u00a01 below low idle speed but only until the engine starts.\n\n\n\n\nCranking shall be stopped within 1 s of starting the engine. If the engine does not start after 15\u00a0s of cranking, cranking shall be stopped and the reason for the failure to start determined, unless the end-users' instructions or the service-repair manual describes a longer cranking time as normal.\n7.5.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine stalling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nIf the engine stalls anywhere during the cold-start NRTC, the test shall be voided;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nIf the engine stalls anywhere during the hot-start NRTC, the test shall be voided. The engine shall be soaked according to point 7.4.2.1(b), and the hot-start run repeated. In this case, the cold-start run does not need to be repeated;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nIf the engine stalls anywhere during the LSI-NRTC, the test shall be voided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nIf the engine stalls anywhere during the NRSC (discrete or ramped), the test shall be voided and be repeated beginning with the engine warm-up procedure. In the case of PM measurement utilizing the multi-filter method (one sampling filter for each operating mode), the test shall be continued by stabilizing the engine at the previous mode for engine temperature conditioning and then initiating measurement with the mode where the engine stalled.\n\n\n\n\n7.5.1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine operation\nThe \u2018operator\u2019 may be a person (i.e., manual), or a governor (i.e., automatic) that mechanically or electronically signals an input that demands engine output. Input may be from an accelerator pedal or signal, a throttle-control lever or signal, a fuel lever or signal, a speed lever or signal, or a governor set point or signal.\n7.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine mapping\nBefore starting the engine mapping, the engine shall be warmed up and towards the end of the warm up it shall be operated for at least 10 minutes at maximum power or according to the recommendation of the manufacturer and good engineering judgement in order to stabilize the engine coolant and lube oil temperatures. When the engine is stabilized, the engine mapping shall be performed.\nWhere the manufacturer intends to use the torque signal broadcast by the electronic control unit, of engines so equipped, during the conduct of in-service monitoring tests according to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017\/655 on monitoring of emissions of in-service engines, the verification set out in Appendix 3 shall additionally be performed during the engine mapping.\nExcept constant-speed engines, engine mapping shall be performed with fully open fuel lever or governor using discrete speeds in ascending order. The minimum and maximum mapping speeds are defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum mapping speed\n\n\n=\n\n\nwarm idle speed\n\n\n\n\nMaximum mapping speed\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nn\nhi \u00d7 1,02 or speed where max torque drops off to zero, whichever is smaller.\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\nn\nhi\n\n is the high speed, as defined in Article 2(12).\nIf the highest speed is unsafe or unrepresentative (e.g., for ungoverned engines), good engineering judgement shall be used to map up to the maximum safe speed or the maximum representative speed.\n7.6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine mapping for variable-speed NRSC\nIn the case of engine mapping for a variable-speed NRSC (only for engines which have not to run the NRTC or LSI-NRTC cycle), good engineering judgment shall be used to select a sufficient number of evenly spaced set-points. At each set-point, speed shall be stabilized and torque allowed to stabilize at least for 15 seconds. The mean speed and torque shall be recorded at each set-point. It is recommended that the mean speed and torque are calculated using the recorded data from the last 4 to 6 seconds. Linear interpolation shall be used to determine the NRSC test speeds and torques if needed. When engines are additionally required to run an NRTC or LSI-NRTC, the NRTC engine mapping curve shall be used to determine steady-state test speeds and torques.\nAt the choice of the manufacturer the engine mapping may alternatively be conducted according to the procedure in point 7.6.2.\n7.6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine mapping for NRTC and LSI-NRTC\nThe engine mapping shall be performed according to the following procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe engine shall be unloaded and operated at idle speed;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nFor engines with a low-speed governor, the operator demand shall be set to the minimum, the dynamometer or another loading device shall be used to target a torque of zero on the engine's primary output shaft and the engine shall be allowed to govern the speed. This warm idle speed shall be measured;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nFor engines without a low-speed governor, the dynamometer shall be set to target a torque of zero on the engine's primary output shaft, and the operator demand shall be set to control the speed to the manufacturer-declared lowest engine speed possible with minimum load (also known as manufacturer-declared warm idle speed);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\n\nThe manufacturer declared idle torque may be used for all variable-speed engines (with or without a low-speed governor), if a nonzero idle torque is representative of in-use operation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nOperator demand shall be set to maximum and engine speed shall be controlled to between warm idle and 95 % of its warm idle speed. For engines with reference duty cycles, which lowest speed is greater than warm idle speed, the mapping may be started at between the lowest reference speed and 95 % of the lowest reference speed;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nThe engine speed shall be increased at an average rate of 8 \u00b1 1 min\u2013 1\/s or the engine shall be mapped by using a continuous sweep of speed at a constant rate such that it takes 4 to 6 min to sweep from minimum to maximum mapping speed. The mapping speed range shall be started between warm idle and 95 % of warm idle and ended at the highest speed above maximum power at which less than 70 % of maximum power occurs. If this highest speed is unsafe or unrepresentative (e.g., for ungoverned engines), good engineering judgment shall be used to map up to the maximum safe speed or the maximum representative speed. Engine speed and torque points shall be recorded at a sample rate of at least 1 Hz;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nIf a manufacturer believes that the above mapping techniques are unsafe or unrepresentative for any given engine, alternate mapping techniques may be used. These alternate techniques shall satisfy the intent of the specified mapping procedures to determine the maximum available torque at all engine speeds achieved during the test cycles. Deviations from the mapping techniques specified in this section for reasons of safety or representativeness shall be approved by the approval authority along with the justification for their use. In no case, however, the torque curve shall be run by descending engine speeds for governed or turbocharged engines;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nAn engine need not be mapped before each and every test cycle. An engine shall be remapped if:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nan unreasonable amount of time has transpired since the last map, as determined by good engineering judgment; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nphysical changes or recalibrations have been made to the engine which potentially affect engine performance; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\n\nthe atmospheric pressure near the engine's air inlet is not within \u00b1 5 kPa of the value recorded at the time of the last engine map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine mapping for constant-speed NRSC\nThe engine may be operated with a production constant-speed governor or a constant-speed governor maybe simulated by controlling engine speed with an operator demand control system. Either isochronous or speed-droop governor operation shall be used, as appropriate.\n7.6.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rated power check for engines to be tested on cycles D2 or E2\nThe following check shall be conducted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nWith the governor or simulated governor controlling speed using operator demand the engine shall be operated at the rated speed and the rated power for as long as required to achieve stable operation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe torque shall be increased until the engine is unable to maintain the governed speed. The power at this point shall be recorded. Before this check is performed the method to safely determine when this point has been reached shall be agreed between the manufacturer and the technical service conducting the check, depending upon the characteristics of the governor. The power recorded at point (b) shall not exceed the rated power as defined in Article 3(25) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628 by more than 12,5 %. If this value is exceeded the manufacturer shall revise the declared rated power.\n\n\n\n\nIf the specific engine being tested is unable to perform this check due to risk of damage to the engine or dynamometer the manufacturer shall present to the approval authority robust evidence that maximum power does not exceed the rated power by more than 12,5 %.\n7.6.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mapping procedure for constant-speed NRSC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nWith the governor or simulated governor controlling speed using operator demand, the engine shall be operated at no-load governed speed (at high speed, not low idle) for at least 15 seconds, unless the specific engine is unable to perform this task;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe dynamometer shall be used to increase torque at a constant rate. The map shall be conducted such that it takes no less than 2 min to sweep from no-load governed speed to the torque corresponding to rated power for engines to be tested on cycle D2 or E2 or to maximum torque in the case of other constant-speed test cycles.

Speed and torque commands shall be issued at a frequency of at least 5 Hz. Because the reference test cycle is specified at 1 Hz, the in between speed and torque commands shall be linearly interpolated from the reference torque values generated from cycle generation.\nSmall denormalized speed values near warm idle speed may cause low-speed idle governors to activate and the engine torque to exceed the reference torque even though the operator demand is at a minimum. In such cases, it is recommended to control the dynamometer so it gives priority to follow the reference torque instead of the reference speed and let the engine govern the speed.\nUnder cold-start conditions engines may use an enhanced-idle device to quickly warm up the engine and the exhaust after-treatment system. Under these conditions, very low normalized speeds will generate reference speeds below this higher enhanced idle speed.

However, it may be useful to consider these verifications to define a specification for a new instrument, to verify the performance of a new instrument upon delivery, or to troubleshoot an existing instrument.\n8.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Linearity verification\n8.1.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope and frequency\nA linearity verification shall be performed on each measurement system listed in Table 6.5 at least as frequently as indicated in the Table, consistent with measurement system manufacturer recommendations and good engineering judgment. The intent of a linearity verification is to determine that a measurement system responds proportionally over the measurement range of interest. A linearity verification shall consist of introducing a series of at least 10 reference values to a measurement system, unless otherwise specified. The measurement system quantifies each reference value. The measured values shall be collectively compared to the reference values by using a least squares linear regression and the linearity criteria specified in Table 6.5.\n8.1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Performance requirements\nIf a measurement system does not meet the applicable linearity criteria in Table 6.5, the deficiency shall be corrected by re-calibrating, servicing, or replacing components as needed. The linearity verification shall be repeated after correcting the deficiency to ensure that the measurement system meets the linearity criteria.\n8.1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure\nThe following linearity verification protocol shall be used:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nA measurement system shall be operated at its specified temperatures, pressures, and flows;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe instrument shall be zeroed as it would before an emission test by introducing a zero signal. For gas analyzers, a zero gas shall be used that meets the specifications of point 9.5.1 and it shall be introduced directly at the analyzer port;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nThe instrument shall be spanned as it would before an emission test by introducing a span signal. For gas analyzers, a span gas shall be used that meets the specifications of point 9.5.1 and it shall be introduced directly at the analyzer port;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nAfter spanning the instrument, zero shall be checked with the same signal which has been used in paragraph (b) of this point. Based on the zero reading, good engineering judgment shall be used to determine whether or not to re-zero and or re-span the instrument before proceeding to the next step;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nFor all measured quantities manufacturer recommendations and good engineering judgment shall be used to select the reference values, y\nref\n\ni\n, that cover the full range of values that are expected during emission testing, thus avoiding the need of extrapolation beyond these values. A zero reference signal shall be selected as one of the reference values of the linearity verification. For stand-alone pressure and temperature linearity verifications, at least three reference values shall be selected. For all other linearity verifications, at least ten reference values shall be selected;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nInstrument manufacturer recommendations and good engineering judgment shall be used to select the order in which the series of reference values will be introduced;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nReference quantities shall be generated and introduced as described in point 8.1.4.4. For gas analyzers, gas concentrations known to be within the specifications of point 9.5.1 shall be used and they shall be introduced directly at the analyzer port;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h)\n\n\nTime for the instrument to stabilize while it measures the reference value shall be allowed;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\nAt a recording frequency of at least the minimum frequency, as specified in Table 6.7, the reference value shall be measured for 30 s and the arithmetic mean of the recorded values, \n\n recorded;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(j)\n\n\nSteps in paragraphs (g) to (i) of this point shall be repeated until all reference quantities are measured;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(k)\n\nThe arithmetic means \n\n, and reference values, y\nref\n\ni\n, shall be used to calculate least-squares linear regression parameters and statistical values to compare to the minimum performance criteria specified in Table 6.5. The calculations described in Appendix 3 of Annex VII shall be used.\n\n\n\n8.1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reference signals\nThis point describes recommended methods for generating reference values for the linearity-verification protocol in point 8.1.4.3. Reference values shall be used that simulate actual values, or an actual value shall be introduced and measured with a reference-measurement system. In the latter case, the reference value is the value reported by the reference-measurement system. Reference values and reference-measurement systems shall be internationally traceable.\nFor temperature measurement systems with sensors like thermocouples, RTDs, and thermistors, the linearity verification may be performed by removing the sensor from the system and using a simulator in its place. A simulator that is independently calibrated and cold junction compensated, as necessary shall be used. The internationally traceable simulator uncertainty scaled to temperature shall be less than 0,5 % of maximum operating temperature T\nmax. If this option is used, it is necessary to use sensors that the supplier states are accurate to better than 0,5 % of T\nmax compared to their standard calibration curve.\n8.1.4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement systems that require linearity verification\nTable 6.5 indicates measurement systems that require linearity verifications. For this Table the following provisions shall apply:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\na linearity verification shall be performed more frequently if the instrument manufacturer recommends it or based on good engineering judgment;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\u2018min\u2019 refers to the minimum reference value used during the linearity verification;\nNote that this value may be zero or a negative value depending on the signal;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\u2018max\u2019 generally refers to the maximum reference value used during the linearity verification.

For example, a specified range of 0,98-1,02 for the slope a\n1 means 0,98 \u2264 a\n1 \u2264 1,02;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nthese linearity verifications are not required for systems that pass the flow-rate verification for diluted exhaust gas as described in point 8.1.8.5 for the propane check or for systems that agree within \u00b1 2 % based on a chemical balance of carbon or oxygen of the intake air, fuel, and exhaust gas;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\n\na\n1 criteria for these quantities shall be met only if the absolute value of the quantity is required, as opposed to a signal that is only linearly proportional to the actual value;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nstand-alone temperatures include engine temperatures and ambient conditions used to set or verify engine conditions; temperatures used to set or verify critical conditions in the test system; and temperatures used in emissions calculations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nthese temperature linearity checks are required. Air intake; after-treatment bed(s) (for engines tested with exhaust after-treatment systems on cycles with cold start criteria); dilution air for PM sampling (CVS, double dilution, and partial flow systems); PM sample; and chiller sample (for gaseous sampling systems that use chillers to dry samples);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nthese temperature linearity checks are only required if specified by the engine manufacturer. Fuel inlet; test cell charge air cooler air outlet (for engines tested with a test cell heat exchanger simulating a non-road mobile machinery charge air cooler); test cell charge air cooler coolant inlet (for engines tested with a test cell heat exchanger simulating a non-road mobile machinery charge air cooler); and oil in the sump\/pan; coolant before the thermostat (for liquid cooled engines);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h)\n\n\nstand-alone pressures include engine pressures and ambient conditions used to set or verify engine conditions; pressures used to set or verify critical conditions in the test system; and pressures used in emissions calculations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nrequired pressure linearity checks are: intake air pressure restriction; exhaust gas back-pressure; barometer; CVS inlet gage pressure (if measurement using CVS); chiller sample (for gaseous sampling systems that use chillers to dry samples);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\npressure linearity checks that are required only if specified by the engine manufacturer: test cell charge air cooler and interconnecting pipe pressure drop (for turbo-charged engines tested with a test cell heat exchanger simulating a non-road mobile machinery charge air cooler) fuel inlet; and fuel outlet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.5\n\n\nMeasurement systems that require linearity verifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement System\n\n\nQuantity\n\n\nMinimum verification frequency\n\n\nLinearity Criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\nSEE\n\n\n\nr\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nEngine speed\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 0,05 % n\nmax\n\n\n\n0,98-1,02\n\n\n\u2264 2 % n\nmax\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,990\n\n\n\n\nEngine torque\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % T\nmax\n\n\n\n0,98-1,02\n\n\n\u2264 2 % T\nmax\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,990\n\n\n\n\nFuel flow rate\n\n\n\nqm\n\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % qm\n\n, max\n\n\n\n0,98-1,02\n\n\n\u2264 2 % qm\n\n, max\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,990\n\n\n\n\nIntake-air flow rate\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\nqV\n\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n0,98-1,02\n\n\n\u2264 2 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,990\n\n\n\n\nDilution air flow rate\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\nqV\n\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n0,98-1,02\n\n\n\u2264 2 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,990\n\n\n\n\nDiluted exhaust gas flow rate\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\nqV\n\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n0,98-1,02\n\n\n\u2264 2 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,990\n\n\n\n\nRaw exhaust gas flow rate\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\nqV\n\n\n\n\nWithin 185 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n0,98-1,02\n\n\n\u2264 2 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,990\n\n\n\n\nBatch sampler flow rates\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\nqV\n\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n0,98-1,02\n\n\n\u2264 2 % qV\n\n, max\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,990\n\n\n\n\nGas dividers\n\n\n\nx\/x\nspan\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 0,5 % x\nmax\n\n\n\n0,98-1,02\n\n\n\u2264 2 % x\nmax\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,990\n\n\n\n\nGas analyzers\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\nWithin 35 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 0,5 % x\nmax\n\n\n\n0,99-1,01\n\n\n\u2264 1 % x\nmax\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,998\n\n\n\n\nPM balance\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % m\nmax\n\n\n\n0,99-1,01\n\n\n\u2264 1 % m\nmax\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,998\n\n\n\n\nStand-alone pressures\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % p\nmax\n\n\n\n0,99-1,01\n\n\n\u2264 1 % p\nmax\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,998\n\n\n\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion of stand-alone temperature signals\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\nWithin 370 days before testing\n\n\n\u2264 1 % T\nmax\n\n\n\n0,99-1,01\n\n\n\u2264 1 % T\nmax\n\n\n\n\u2265 0,998\n\n\n\n\n8.1.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Continuous gas analyser system-response and updating-recording verification\nThis section describes a general verification procedure for continuous gas analyzer system response and update recording. See point 8.1.6 for verification procedures for compensation type analysers.\n8.1.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope and frequency\nThis verification shall be performed after installing or replacing a gas analyzer that is used for continuous sampling. Also this verification shall be performed if the system is reconfigured in a way that would change system response. This verification is needed for continuous gas analysers used for transient (NRTC and LSI-NRTC) test cycles or RMC but is not needed for batch gas analyzer systems or for continuous gas analyzer systems used only for testing with a discrete-mode NRSC.\n8.1.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement principles\nThis test verifies that the updating and recording frequencies match the overall system response to a rapid change in the value of concentrations at the sample probe. Gas analyzer systems shall be optimized such that their overall response to a rapid change in concentration is updated and recorded at an appropriate frequency to prevent loss of information. This test also verifies that continuous gas analyzer systems meet a minimum response time.\nThe system settings for the response time evaluation shall be exactly the same as during measurement of the test run (i.e. pressure, flow rates, filter settings on the analyzers and all other response time influences). The response time determination shall be done with gas switching directly at the inlet of the sample probe. The devices for gas switching shall have a specification to perform the switching in less than 0,1 s. The gases used for the test shall cause a concentration change of at least 60 % full scale (FS).\nThe concentration trace of each single gas component shall be recorded.\n8.1.5.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0System requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe system response time shall be \u2264 10 s with a rise time of \u2264 5 s for all measured components (CO, NOx, 2 and HC) and all ranges used.\nAll data (concentration, fuel and air flows) have to be shifted by their measured response times before performing the emission calculations given in Annex VII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nTo demonstrate acceptable updating and recording with respect to the system's overall response, the system shall meet one of the following criteria:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nThe product of the mean rise time and the frequency at which the system records an updated concentration shall be at least 5. In any case the mean rise time shall be no more than 10 s;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nThe frequency at which the system records the concentration shall be at least 2 Hz (see also Table 6.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.5.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure\nThe following procedure shall be used to verify the response of each continuous gas analyzer system:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe analyzer system manufacturer's start-up and operating instructions for the instrument setup shall be followed. The measurement system shall be adjusted as needed to optimize performance. This verification shall be run with the analyzer operating in the same manner as used for emission testing. If the analyzer shares its sampling system with other analyzers, and if gas flow to the other analyzers will affect the system response time, then the other analyzers shall be started up and operated while running this verification test. This verification test may be run on multiple analyzers sharing the same sampling system at the same time. If analogue or real-time digital filters are used during emission testing, those filters shall be operated in the same manner during this verification;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFor equipment used to validate system response time, minimal gas transfer line lengths between all connections are recommended to be used, a zero-air source shall be connected to one inlet of a fast-acting 3-way valve (2 inlets, 1 outlet) in order to control the flow of zero and blended span gases to the sample system's probe inlet or a tee near the outlet of the probe. Normally the gas flow rate is higher than the probe sample flow rate and the excess is overflowed out the inlet of the probe. If the gas flow rate is lower than the probe flow rate, the gas concentrations shall be adjusted to account for the dilution from ambient air drawn into the probe. Binary or multi-gas span gases may be used. A gas blending or mixing device may be used to blend span gases. A gas blending or mixing device is recommended when blending span gases diluted in N2 with span gases diluted in air;\nUsing a gas divider, an NO\u2013CO\u2013CO2\u2013C3H8\u2013CH4 (balance N2) span gas shall be equally blended with a span gas of NO2, balance purified synthetic air. Standard binary span gases may be also be used, where applicable, in place of blended NO-CO-CO2-C3H8-CH4, balance N2 span gas; in this case separate response tests shall be run for each analyzer. The gas divider outlet shall be connected to the other inlet of the 3-way valve. The valve outlet shall be connected to an overflow at the gas analyzer system's probe or to an overflow fitting between the probe and transfer line to all the analyzers being verified. A setup that avoids pressure pulsations due to stopping the flow through the gas blending device shall be used. Any of these gas constituents if they are not relevant to the analyzers for this verification shall be omitted.

The value for each result shall be at least 5. If the value is less than 5, the recording frequency shall be increased or the flows adjusted or the design of the sampling system shall be changed to increase the rise time as needed. Also digital filters may be configured to increase rise time;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nIf it is chosen to demonstrate compliance with point 8.1.5.3(b)(ii), the demonstration of compliance with the requirements of point 8.1.5.3(b)(ii) is sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Response time verification for compensation type analysers\n8.1.6.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope and frequency\nThis verification shall be performed to determine a continuous gas analyzer's response, where one analyzer's response is compensated by another's to quantify a gaseous emission. For this check water vapour shall be considered to be a gaseous constituent. This verification is required for continuous gas analyzers used for transient (NRTC and LSI-NRTC) test cycles or RMC. This verification is not needed for batch gas analyzers or for continuous gas analyzers that are used only for testing with a discrete-mode NRSC. This verification does not apply to correction for water removed from the sample done in post-processing. This verification shall be performed after initial installation (i.e. test cell commissioning). After major maintenance, point 8.1.5 may be used to verify uniform response provided that any replaced components have gone through a humidified uniform response verification at some point.\n8.1.6.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement principles\nThis procedure verifies the time-alignment and uniform response of continuously combined gas measurements. For this procedure, it is necessary to ensure that all compensation algorithms and humidity corrections are turned on.\n8.1.6.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0System requirements\nThe general response time and rise time requirement set out in point 8.1.5.3(a) is also valid for compensation type analysers. Additionally, if the recording frequency is different than the update frequency of the continuously combined\/compensated signal, the lower of these two frequencies shall be used for the verification required by point 8.1.5.3(b)(i).\n8.1.6.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedure\nAll procedures set out in point 8.1.5.4(a) to (c) shall be used. Additionally also the response and rise time of water vapour has to be measured, if a compensation algorithm based on measured water vapour is used. In this case at least one of the used calibration gases (but not NO2) has to be humidified as follows:\nIf the system does not use a sample dryer to remove water from the sample gas, the span gas shall be humidified by flowing the gas mixture through a sealed vessel that humidifies the gas to the highest sample dew point that is estimated during emission sampling by bubbling it through distilled water. If the system uses a sample dryer during testing that has passed the sample dryer verification check, the humidified gas mixture may be introduced downstream of the sample dryer by bubbling it through distilled water in a sealed vessel at 298 \u00b1 10 K (25 \u00b1 10 \u00b0C), or a temperature greater than the dew point. In all cases, downstream of the vessel, the humidified gas shall be maintained at a temperature of at least 5 K (5 \u00b0C) above its local dew point in the line. Note that it is possible to omit any of these gas constituents if they are not relevant to the analyzers for this verification. If any of the gas constituents are not susceptible to water compensation, the response check for these analyzers may be performed without humidification.\n8.1.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement of engine parameters and ambient conditions\nThe engine manufacturer shall apply internal quality procedures traceable to recognised national or international standards.

Good engineering judgment shall be used to repeat the calibration. The torque transducer manufacturer's instructions shall be followed for linearizing the torque sensor's output. Other calibration methods are permitted.\n8.1.7.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dead-weight calibration\nThis technique applies a known force by hanging known weights at a known distance along a lever arm. It shall be made sure that the weights' lever arm is perpendicular to gravity (i.e., horizontal) and perpendicular to the dynamometer's rotational axis. At least six calibration-weight combinations shall be applied for each applicable torque-measuring range, spacing the weight quantities about equally over the range. The dynamometer shall be oscillated or rotated during calibration to reduce frictional static hysteresis. Each weight's force shall be determined by multiplying its internationally-traceable mass by the local acceleration of Earth's gravity.\n8.1.7.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strain gage or proving ring calibration\nThis technique applies force either by hanging weights on a lever arm (these weights and their lever arm length are not used as part of the reference torque determination) or by operating the dynamometer at different torques. At least six force combinations shall be applied for each applicable torque-measuring range, spacing the force quantities about equally over the range. The dynamometer shall be oscillated or rotated during calibration to reduce frictional static hysteresis. In this case, the reference torque is determined by multiplying the force output from the reference meter (such as a strain gage or proving ring) by its effective lever-arm length, which is measured from the point where the force measurement is made to the dynamometer's rotational axis. It shall be made sure that this length is measured perpendicular to the reference meter's measurement axis and perpendicular to the dynamometer's rotational axis.\n8.1.7.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pressure, temperature, and dew point calibration\nInstruments shall be calibrated for measuring pressure, temperature, and dew point upon initial installation.

This calibration shall be performed after any part of the flow configuration upstream or downstream of the flow meter has been changed that may affect the flow-meter calibration. This calibration shall be performed upon initial CVS installation and whenever corrective action does not resolve a failure to meet the diluted exhaust gas flow verification (i.e., propane check) in point 8.1.8.5;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nA CVS flow meter shall be calibrated using a reference flow meter such as a subsonic venturi flow meter, a long-radius flow nozzle, a smooth approach orifice, a laminar flow element, a set of critical flow venturis, or an ultrasonic flow meter. A reference flow meter shall be used that reports quantities that are internationally-traceable within \u00b1 1 % uncertainty. This reference flow meter's response to flow shall be used as the reference value for CVS flow-meter calibration;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nAn upstream screen or other pressure restriction that could affect the flow ahead of the reference flow meter may not be used, unless the flow meter has been calibrated with such a pressure restriction;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nThe calibration sequence described under this point 8.1.8.4 refers to the molar based approach. For the corresponding sequence used in the mass based approach, see point 2.5 of Annex VII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nBy the choice of the manufacturer, CFV or SSV may alternatively be removed from its permanent position for calibration as long as the following requirements are met when installed in the CVS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\nUpon installation of the CFV or SSV into the CVS, good engineering judgment shall be applied to verify that any leaks have not been introduced between the CVS inlet and the venturi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nAfter ex-situ venturi calibration, all venturi flow combinations must be verified for CFVs or at minimum of 10 flow points for an SSV using the propane check as described in point 8.1.8.5. The result of the propane check for each venturi flow point may not exceed the tolerance in point 8.1.8.5.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nIn order to verify the ex-situ calibration for a CVS with more than a single CFV, the following verification shall be conducted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nA constant flow device shall be used to deliver a constant flow of propane to the dilution tunnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nThe hydrocarbon concentrations shall be measured at a minimum of 10 separate flow rates for an SSV flow meter, or at all possible flow combinations for a CFV flow meter, while keeping the flow of propane constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\n\nThe concentration of hydrocarbon background in the dilution air shall be measured at the beginning and end of this test. The average background concentration from each measurement at each flow point must be subtracted before performing the regression analysis in paragraph (iv).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv)\n\n\nA power regression has to be performed using all the paired values of flow rate and corrected concentration to obtain a relationship in the form of y = a \u00d7 xb, using the concentration as the independent variable and the flow rate as the dependent variable. For each data point, the calculation of the difference between the measured flow rate and the value represented by the curve fit is required. The difference at each point must be less than \u00b1 1 % of the appropriate regression value. The value of b must be between \u2013 1,005 and \u2013 0,995. If the results do not meet these limits, corrective actions consistent with point 8.1.8.5.1(a) must be taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.8.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PDP calibration\nA positive-displacement pump (PDP) shall be calibrated to determine a flow-versus-PDP speed equation that accounts for flow leakage across sealing surfaces in the PDP as a function of PDP inlet pressure.

A propane check also serves as a batch-sampler verification to determine if there is a discrepancy in a batch sampling system that extracts a sample from a CVS, as described in paragraph (f) of this point. Using good engineering judgment and safe practices, this check may be performed using a gas other than propane, such as CO2 or CO. A failed propane check might indicate one or more problems that may require corrective action, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nIncorrect analyzer calibration. The FID analyzer shall be re-calibrated, repaired, or replaced;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nLeak checks shall be performed on CVS tunnel, connections, fasteners, and HC sampling system according to point 8.1.8.7;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\n\nThe verification for poor mixing shall be performed in accordance with point 9.2.2;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv)\n\n\nThe hydrocarbon contamination verification in the sample system shall be performed as described in point 7.3.1.2;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(v)\n\n\nChange in CVS calibration.

If a reference flow rate is used, any non-ideal gas behaviour of C3H8 in the reference flow meter shall be accounted for. See section 2 of Annex VII (mass based approach) or section 3 of Annex VII (molar based approach), which describe how to calibrate and use certain flow meters. No ideal gas assumption may be used in point 8.1.8.5 and Annex VII. The propane check compares the calculated mass of injected C3H8 using HC measurements and CVS flow rate measurements with the reference value.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.8.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Method of introducing a known amount of propane into the CVS system\nThe total accuracy of the CVS sampling system and analytical system shall be determined by introducing a known mass of a pollutant gas into the system while it is being operated in the normal manner.

As an alternative to using a gas divider, another simple gas blending device may be used. In this case an analyzer shall be used to determine CO2 concentration. If a NDIR is used together with a simple gas blending device, it shall meet the requirements of this section and it shall be spanned with the CO2 span gas from paragraph (d) of this point.

If the humidified NO span gas sample does not pass through a sample dryer, the quench verification calculations in point 8.1.11.2.3 scale the measured H2O quench to the highest mole fraction of H2O expected during emission testing. If the humidified NO span gas sample passes through a dryer for this verification test, the vessel temperature shall be controlled to generate an H2O level at least as high as the level required in point 9.3.2.3.1.

The buoyancy correction depends on the sample media density, the density of air, and the density of the calibration weight used to calibrate the balance. The buoyancy correction does not account for the buoyancy of the PM itself, because the mass of PM typically accounts for only (0,01 to 0,10) % of the total weight. A correction to this small fraction of mass would be at the most 0,010 %. The buoyancy-corrected values are the tare masses of the PM samples. These buoyancy-corrected values of the pre-test filter weighing are subsequently subtracted from the buoyancy-corrected values of the post-test weighing of the corresponding filter to determine the mass of PM emitted during the test.\n8.1.12.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PM sample filter density\nDifferent PM sample filter have different densities. The known density of the sample media shall be used, or one of the densities for some common sampling media shall be used, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nFor PTFE-coated borosilicate glass, a sample media density of 2\u00a0300 kg\/m3 shall be used;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFor PTFE membrane (film) media with an integral support ring of polymethylpentene that accounts for 95 % of the media mass, a sample media density of 920 kg\/m3 shall be used;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nFor PTFE membrane (film) media with an integral support ring of PTFE, a sample media density of 2\u00a0144 kg\/m3 shall be used.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.12.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Air density\nBecause a PM balance environment shall be tightly controlled to an ambient temperature of 295 \u00b1 1 K (22 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) and a dew point of 282,5 \u00b1 1 K (9,5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C), air density is primarily function of atmospheric pressure. Therefore a buoyancy correction is specified that is only a function of atmospheric pressure.\n8.1.12.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calibration weight density\nThe stated density of the material of the metal calibration weight shall be used.\n8.1.12.2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Correction calculation\nThe PM sample filter shall be corrected for buoyancy by means of equation (6-27):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6-27)\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm\ncor\n\n\n\nis the PM sample filter mass corrected for buoyancy\n\n\n\n\n\nm\nuncor\n\n\n\nis the PM sample filter mass uncorrected for buoyancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\nair\n\n\n\nis the density of air in balance environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\nweight\n\n\n\nis the density of calibration weight used to span balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c1\nmedia\n\n\n\nis the density of PM sample filter\n\n\n\n\nwith\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(6-28)\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\nabs\n\n\n\nis the absolute pressure in balance environment\n\n\n\n\n\nM\nmix\n\n\n\nis the molar mass of air in balance environment\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\nis the molar gas constant.\n\n\n\n\n\nT\namb\n\n\n\nis the absolute ambient temperature of balance environment\n\n\n\n\n8.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instrument validation for test\n8.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Validation of proportional flow control for batch sampling and minimum dilution ratio for PM batch sampling\n8.2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proportionality criteria for CVS\n8.2.1.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proportional flows\nFor any pair of flow meters, the recorded sample and total flow rates or their 1 Hz means shall be used with the statistical calculations in Appendix 3 of Annex VII. The standard error of the estimate, SEE, of the sample flow rate versus the total flow rate shall be determined. For each test interval, it shall be demonstrated that SEE was less than or equal to 3,5 % of the mean sample flow rate.\n8.2.1.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Constant flows\nFor any pair of flow meters, the recorded sample and total flow rates or their 1 Hz means shall be used to demonstrate that each flow rate was constant within \u00b1 2,5 % of its respective mean or target flow rate. The following options may be used instead of recording the respective flow rate of each type of meter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nCritical-flow venturi option. For critical-flow venturis, the recorded venturi-inlet conditions or their 1 Hz means shall be used. It shall be demonstrated that the flow density at the venturi inlet was constant within \u00b1 2,5 % of the mean or target density over each test interval. For a CVS critical-flow venturi, this may be demonstrated by showing that the absolute temperature at the venturi inlet was constant within \u00b1 4 % of the mean or target absolute temperature over each test interval;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nPositive-displacement pump option. The recorded pump-inlet conditions or their 1 Hz means shall be used. It shall be demonstrated that the flow density at the pump inlet was constant within \u00b1 2,5 % of the mean or target density over each test interval. For a CVS pump, this may be demonstrated by showing that the absolute temperature at the pump inlet was constant within \u00b1 2 % of the mean or target absolute temperature over each test interval.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.1.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Demonstration of proportional sampling\nFor any proportional batch sample such as a bag or PM filter, it shall be demonstrated that proportional sampling was maintained using one of the following, noting that up to 5 % of the total number of data points may be omitted as outliers.\nUsing good engineering judgment, it shall be demonstrated with an engineering analysis that the proportional-flow control system inherently ensures proportional sampling under all circumstances expected during testing. For example, CFVs may be used for both sample flow and total flow if it is demonstrated that they always have the same inlet pressures and temperatures and that they always operate under critical-flow conditions.\nMeasured or calculated flows and\/or tracer gas concentrations (e.g. CO2) shall be used to determine the minimum dilution ratio for PM batch sampling over the test interval.\n8.2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Partial flow dilution system validation\nFor the control of a partial flow dilution system to extract a proportional raw exhaust gas sample, a fast system response is required; this is identified by the promptness of the partial flow dilution system. The transformation time for the system shall be determined in accordance with the procedure set out in point 8.1.8.6.3.2. The actual control of the partial flow dilution system shall be based on the current measured conditions. If the combined transformation time of the exhaust gas flow measurement and the partial flow system is \u2264 0,3 s, online control shall be used. If the transformation time exceeds 0,3 s, look-ahead control based on a pre-recorded test run shall be used. In this case, the combined rise time shall be \u2264 1 s and the combined delay time \u2264 10 s. The total system response shall be designed as to ensure a representative sample of the particulates, qm\n\np,i (sample flow of exhaust gas into partial flow dilution system), proportional to the exhaust gas mass flow. To determine the proportionality, a regression analysis of qm\n\np,i versus qm\n\new,i (exhaust gas mass flow rate on wet basis) shall be conducted on a minimum 5 Hz data acquisition rate, and the following criteria shall be met:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe correlation coefficient r\n2 of the linear regression between qm\n\np,i and qm\n\new,i shall not be less than 0,95;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe standard error of estimate of qm\n\np,i on qm\n\new,i shall not exceed 5 % of qm\n\np maximum;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\nqm\n\np intercept of the regression line shall not exceed \u00b1 2 % of qm\n\np maximum.\n\n\n\n\nLook-ahead control is required if the combined transformation times of the particulate system, t\n50,P and of the exhaust gas mass flow signal, t\n50,F are > 0,3 s. In this case, a pre-test shall be run and the exhaust gas mass flow signal of the pre-test be used for controlling the sample flow into the particulate system. A correct control of the partial dilution system is obtained, if the time trace of qm\n\new,pre of the pre-test, which controls qm\n\np, is shifted by a \u2018look-ahead\u2019 time of t\n50,P + t\n50,F.\nFor establishing the correlation between qm\n\np,i and qm\n\new,i the data taken during the actual test shall be used, with qm\n\new,i time aligned by t\n50,F relative to qm\n\np,i (no contribution from t\n50,P to the time alignment). The time shift between qm\n\new and qm\n\np is the difference between their transformation times that were determined in point 8.1.8.6.3.2.\n8.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gas analyzer range validation, drift validation and drift correction\n8.2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Range validation\nIf an analyzer operated above 100 % of its range at any time during the test, the following steps shall be performed:\n8.2.2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Batch sampling\nFor batch sampling, the sample shall be re-analyzed using the lowest analyzer range that results in a maximum instrument response below 100 %. The result shall be reported from the lowest range from which the analyzer operates below 100 % of its range for the entire test.\n8.2.2.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Continuous sampling\nFor continuous sampling, the entire test shall be repeated using the next higher analyzer range. If the analyzer again operates above 100 % of its range, the test shall be repeated using the next higher range. The test shall be continued to be repeated until the analyzer always operates at less than 100 % of its range for the entire test.\n8.2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drift validation and drift correction\nIf the drift is within \u00b11 %, the data can be either accepted without any correction or accepted after correction. If the drift is greater than \u00b1 1 %, two sets of brake specific emission results shall be calculated for each pollutant with a brake-specific limit value and for CO2, or the test shall be voided. One set shall be calculated using data before drift correction and another set of data calculated after correcting all the data for drift in accordance with point 2.6 of Annex VII and Appendix 1 of Annex VII. The comparison shall be made as a percentage of the uncorrected results. The difference between the uncorrected and the corrected brake-specific emission values shall be within \u00b1 4 % of either the uncorrected brake-specific emission values or the emission limit value, whichever is greater. If not, the entire test is void.\n8.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PM sampling media (e.g. filters) preconditioning and tare weighing\nBefore an emission test, the following steps shall be taken to prepare PM sample filter media and equipment for PM measurements:\n8.2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Periodic verifications\nIt shall be made sure that the balance and PM-stabilization environments meet the periodic verifications in point 8.1.12. The reference filter shall be weighed just before weighing test filters to establish an appropriate reference point (see section details of the procedure in point 8.1.12.1). The verification of the stability of the reference filters shall occur after the post-test stabilisation period, immediately before the post-test weighing.\n8.2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Visual Inspection\nThe unused sample filter media shall be visually inspected for defects, defective filters shall be discarded.\n8.2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grounding\nElectrically grounded tweezers or a grounding strap shall be used to handle PM filters as described in point 9.3.4.\n8.2.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unused sample media\nUnused sample media shall be placed in one or more containers that are open to the PM-stabilization environment. If filters are used, they may be placed in the bottom half of a filter cassette.\n8.2.3.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stabilization\nSample media shall be stabilized in the PM-stabilization environment. An unused sample medium can be considered stabilized as long as it has been in the PM-stabilization environment for a minimum of 30 min, during which the PM-stabilization environment has been within the specifications of point 9.3.4. However, if a mass of 400 \u03bcg or more is expected, then the sample media shall be stabilised for at least 60 min.\n8.2.3.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Weighing\nThe sample media shall be weighed automatically or manually, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nFor automatic weighing, the automation system manufacturer's instructions shall be followed to prepare samples for weighing; this may include placing the samples in a special container;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFor manual weighing, good engineering judgment shall be used;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nOptionally, substitution weighing is permitted (see point 8.2.3.10);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nOnce a filter is weighed it shall be returned to the Petri dish and covered.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buoyancy correction\nThe measured weight shall be corrected for buoyancy as described in point 8.1.13.2.\n8.2.3.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Repetition\nThe filter mass measurements may be repeated to determine the average mass of the filter using good engineering judgement and to exclude outliers from the calculation of the average.\n8.2.3.9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tare-weighing\nUnused filters that have been tare-weighed shall be loaded into clean filter cassettes and the loaded cassettes shall be placed in a covered or sealed container before they are taken to the test cell for sampling.\n8.2.3.10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Substitution weighing\nSubstitution weighing is an option and, if used, involves measurement of a reference weight before and after each weighing of a PM sampling medium (e.g. filter). While substitution weighing requires more measurements, it corrects for a balance's zero-drift and it relies on balance linearity only over a small range. This is most appropriate when quantifying total PM masses that are less than 0,1 % of the sample medium's mass. However, it may not be appropriate when total PM masses exceed 1 % of the sample medium's mass. If substitution weighing is used, it shall be used for both pre-test and post-test weighing. The same substitution weight shall be used for both pre-test and post-test weighing. The mass of the substitution weight shall be corrected for buoyancy if the density of the substitution weight is less than 2,0 g\/cm3. The following steps are an example of substitution weighing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nElectrically grounded tweezers or a grounding strap shall be used, as described in point 9.3.4.6;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nA static neutralizer shall be used as described in point 9.3.4.6 to minimize static electric charge on any object before it is placed on the balance pan;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nA substitution weight shall be selected that meets the specifications for calibration weights in point 9.5.2. The substitution weight shall also have the same density as the weight that is used to span the microbalance, and shall be similar in mass to an unused sample medium (e.g. filter). If filters are used, the weight's mass should be about (80 to 100) mg for typical 47 mm diameter filters;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nThe stable balance reading shall be recorded and then the calibration weight shall be removed;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nAn unused sampling medium (e.g. a new filter) shall be weighed, the stable balance reading recorded and the balance environment's dew point, ambient temperature, and atmospheric pressure recorded;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nThe calibration weight shall be reweighed and the stable balance reading recorded;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the two calibration-weight readings that were recorded immediately before and after weighing the unused sample shall be calculated. That mean value shall be subtracted from the unused sample reading, then the true mass of the calibration weight as stated on the calibration-weight certificate shall be added. This result shall be recorded. This is the unused sample's tare weight without correcting for buoyancy;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h)\n\n\nThese substitution-weighing steps shall be repeated for the remainder of the unused sample media;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nThe instructions given in points 8.2.3.7 to 8.2.3.9 shall be followed once weighing is completed.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Post-test PM sample conditioning and weighing\nUsed PM sample filters shall be placed into covered or sealed containers or the filter holders shall be closed, in order to protect the sample filters against ambient contamination. Thus protected, the loaded filters have to be returned to the PM-filter conditioning chamber or room. Then the PM sample filters shall be conditioned and weighted accordingly.\n8.2.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Periodic verification\nIt shall be assured that the weighing and PM-stabilization environments have met the periodic verifications in point 8.1.13.1. After testing is complete, the filters shall be returned to the weighing and PM-stabilisation environment. The weighing and PM-stabilisation environment shall meet the ambient conditions requirements in point 9.3.4.4, otherwise the test filters shall be left covered until proper conditions have been met.\n8.2.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Removal from sealed containers\nIn the PM-stabilization environment, the PM samples shall be removed from the sealed containers. Filters may be removed from their cassettes before or after stabilization. When a filter is removed from a cassette, the top half of the cassette shall be separated from the bottom half using a cassette separator designed for this purpose.\n8.2.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Electrical grounding\nTo handle PM samples, electrically grounded tweezers or a grounding strap shall be used, as described in point 9.3.4.5.\n8.2.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Visual inspection\nThe collected PM samples and the associated filter media shall be inspected visually. If the conditions of either the filter or the collected PM sample appear to have been compromised, or if the particulate matter contacts any surface other than the filter, the sample may not be used to determine particulate emissions. In the case of contact with another surface; the affected surface shall be cleaned before proceeding.\n8.2.4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stabilisation of PM samples\nTo stabilise PM samples, they shall be placed in one or more containers that are open to the PM-stabilization environment, which is described in point 9.3.4.3.A PM sample is stabilized as long as it has been in the PM-stabilization environment for one of the following durations, during which the stabilization environment has been within the specifications of point 9.3.4.3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nIf it is expected that a filter's total surface concentration of PM will be greater than 0,353 \u03bcg\/mm2, assuming a 400 \u03bcg loading on a 38 mm diameter filter stain area, the filter shall be exposed to the stabilization environment for at least 60 minutes before weighing;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nIf it is expected that a filter's total surface concentration of PM will be less than 0,353 \u03bcg\/mm2, the filter shall be exposed to the stabilization environment for at least 30 minutes before weighing;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nIf a filter's total surface concentration of PM to be expected during the test is unknown, the filter shall be exposed to the stabilization environment for at least 60 minutes before weighing.\n\n\n\n\n8.2.4.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determination of post-test filter mass\nThe procedures in point 8.2.3 shall be repeated (points 8.2.3.6 through 8.2.3.9) to determine the post-test filter mass.\n8.2.4.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total mass\nEach buoyancy-corrected filter tare mass shall be subtracted from its respective buoyancy-corrected post-test filter mass. The result is the total mass, m\ntotal, which shall be used in emission calculations in Annex VII.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement equipment\n\n9.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine dynamometer specification\n9.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shaft work\nAn engine dynamometer shall be used that has adequate characteristics to perform the applicable duty cycle including the ability to meet appropriate cycle validation criteria. The following dynamometers may be used:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nEddy-current or water-brake dynamometers;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nAlternating-current or direct-current motoring dynamometers;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nOne or more dynamometers.\n\n\n\n\n9.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transient (NRTC and LSI-NRTC) test cycles\nLoad cell or in-line torque meter may be used for torque measurements.\nWhen using a load cell, the torque signal shall be transferred to the engine axis and the inertia of the dynamometer shall be considered. The actual engine torque is the torque read on the load cell plus the moment of inertia of the brake multiplied by the angular acceleration. The control system has to perform such a calculation in real time.\n9.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine accessories\nThe work of engine accessories required to fuel, lubricate, or heat the engine, circulate liquid coolant to the engine, or to operate exhaust after-treatment systems shall be accounted for and they shall be installed in accordance with point 6.3.\n9.1.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Engine fixture and power transmission shaft system (category NRSh)\nWhere necessary for the proper testing of an engine of category NRSh, the engine fixture for the test bench and power transmission shaft system for connection to the dynamometer rotating system specified by the manufacturer shall be used.\n9.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dilution procedure (if applicable)\n9.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diluent conditions and background concentrations\nGaseous constituents may be measured raw or dilute whereas PM measurement generally requires dilution. Dilution may be accomplished by a full flow or partial flow dilution system. When dilution is applied then the exhaust gas may be diluted with ambient air, synthetic air, or nitrogen. For gaseous emissions measurement the diluent shall be at least 288 K (15 \u00b0C). For PM sampling the temperature of the diluent is specified in points 9.2.2 for CVS and 9.2.3 for PFD with varying dilution ratio. The flow capacity of the dilution system shall be large enough to completely eliminate water condensation in the dilution and sampling systems. De-humidifying the dilution air before entering the dilution system is permitted, if the air humidity is high. The dilution tunnel walls may be heated or insulated as well as the bulk stream tubing downstream of the tunnel to prevent the precipitation of water-containing constituents from a gas phase to a liquid phase (\u2018aqueous condensation\u2019).\nBefore a diluent is mixed with exhaust gas, it may be preconditioned by increasing or decreasing its temperature or humidity. Constituents may be removed from the diluent to reduce their background concentrations. The following provisions apply to removing constituents or accounting for background concentrations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nConstituent concentrations in the diluent may be measured and compensated for background effects on test results. See Annex VII for calculations that compensate for background concentrations;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe following changes to the requirements of sections 7.2, 9.3 and 9.4 are permitted for measuring background gaseous or particulate pollutants:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nIt shall not be required to use proportional sampling;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nUnheated sampling systems may be used;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\n\nContinuous sampling may be used irrespective of the use of batch sampling for diluted emissions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv)\n\n\nBatch sampling may be used irrespective of the use of continuous sampling for diluted emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nTo account for background PM the following options are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nFor removing background PM, the diluent shall be filtered with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that have an initial minimum collection efficiency specification of 99,97 % (see Article 2(19) for procedures related to HEPA-filtration efficiencies);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nFor correcting for background PM without HEPA filtration, the background PM shall not contribute more than 50 % of the net PM collected on the sample filter;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\n\nBackground correction of net PM with HEPA filtration is permitted without pressure restriction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Full flow system\nFull-flow dilution; constant-volume sampling (CVS). The full flow of raw exhaust gas is diluted in a dilution tunnel. Constant flow may be maintained by maintaining the temperature and pressure at the flow meter within the limits. For non-constant flow the flow shall be measured directly to allow for proportional sampling. The system shall be designed as follows (see Figure 6.6):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nA tunnel with inside surfaces of stainless steel shall be used. The entire dilution tunnel shall be electrically grounded. Alternatively non-conductive materials may be used for engine categories neither subject to PM nor PN limits;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe exhaust gas back-pressure shall not be artificially lowered by the dilution air inlet system. The static pressure at the location where raw exhaust gas is introduced into the tunnel shall be maintained within \u00b1 1,2 kPa of atmospheric pressure;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nTo support mixing the raw exhaust gas shall be introduced into the tunnel by directing it downstream along the centreline of the tunnel. A fraction of dilution air maybe introduced radially from the tunnel's inner surface to minimize exhaust gas interaction with the tunnel walls;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nDiluent. For PM sampling the temperature of the diluents (ambient air, synthetic air, or nitrogen as quoted in point 9.2.1) shall be maintained between 293 and 325 K (20 to 52 \u00b0C) in close proximity to the entrance into the dilution tunnel;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nThe Reynolds number, Re, shall be at least 4\u00a0000 for the diluted exhaust gas flow, where Re is based on the inside diameter of the dilution tunnel. Re is defined in Annex VII. Verification of adequate mixing shall be performed while traversing a sampling probe across the tunnel's diameter, vertically and horizontally. If the analyzer response indicates any deviation exceeding \u00b1 2 % of the mean measured concentration, the CVS shall be operated at a higher flow rate or a mixing plate or orifice shall be installed to improve mixing;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nFlow measurement preconditioning. The diluted exhaust gas may be conditioned before measuring its flow rate, as long as this conditioning takes place downstream of heated HC or PM sample probes, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nFlow straighteners, pulsation dampeners, or both of these may be used;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nA filter may be used;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\n\nA heat exchanger may be used to control the temperature upstream of any flow meter but steps shall be taken to prevent aqueous condensation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nAqueous condensation. Aqueous condensation is a function of humidity, pressure, temperature, and concentrations of other constituents such as sulphuric acid. These parameters vary as a function of engine intake-air humidity, dilution-air humidity, engine air-to-fuel ratio, and fuel composition \u2014 including the amount of hydrogen and sulphur in the fuel.\nTo ensure that a flow is measured that corresponds to a measured concentration, either aqueous condensation shall be prevented between the sample probe location and the flow meter inlet in the dilution tunnel or aqueous condensation shall be allowed to occur and humidity at the flow meter inlet measured. The dilution tunnel walls or bulk stream tubing downstream of the tunnel may be heated or insulated to prevent aqueous condensation. Aqueous condensation shall be prevented throughout the dilution tunnel. Certain exhaust gas components can be diluted or eliminated by the presence of moisture;\nFor PM sampling, the already proportional flow coming from CVS goes through secondary dilution (one or more) to achieve the requested overall dilution ratio as shown in Figure 9.2 and set out in point 9.2.3.2;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h)\n\n\nThe minimum overall dilution ratio shall be within the range of 5:1 to 7:1 and at least 2:1 for the primary dilution stage based on the maximum engine exhaust gas flow rate during the test cycle or test interval;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nThe overall residence time in the system shall be between 0,5 and 5 seconds, as measured from the point of diluent introduction to the filter holder(s);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(j)\n\n\nThe residence time in the secondary dilution system, if present, shall be at least 0,5 seconds, as measured from the point of secondary diluent introduction to the filter holder(s).\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the mass of the particulates, a particulate sampling system, a particulate sampling filter, a gravimetric balance, and a temperature and humidity controlled weighing chamber, are required.\n\nFigure 6.6\n\n\nExamples of full-flow dilution sampling configurations\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Partial flow dilution (PFD) system\n9.2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Description of partial flow system\nA schematic of a PFD system is shown in Figure 6.7. It is a general schematic showing principles of sample extraction, dilution and PM sampling. It is not meant to indicate that all the components described in the Figure are necessary for other possible sampling systems that satisfy the intent of sample collection. Other configurations which do not match these schematics are allowed under the condition that they serve the same purpose of sample collection, dilution, and PM sampling. These need to satisfy other criteria such as in points 8.1.8.6 (periodic calibration) and 8.2.1.2 (validation) for varying dilution PFD, and point 8.1.4.5 as well as Table 8.2 (linearity verification) and point 8.1.8.5.7 (verification) for constant dilution PFD.\nAs shown in Figure 6.7, the raw exhaust gas or the primary diluted flow is transferred from the exhaust pipe EP or from CVS respectively to the dilution tunnel DT through the sampling probe SP and the transfer line TL. The total flow through the tunnel is adjusted with a flow controller and the sampling pump P of the particulate sampling system (PSS). For proportional raw exhaust gas sampling, the dilution air flow is controlled by the flow controller FC1, which may use qm\n\new (exhaust gas mass flow rate on wet basis) or qm\n\naw (intake air mass flow rate on wet basis) and qm\n\nf (fuel mass flow rate) as command signals, for the desired exhaust gas split. The sample flow into the dilution tunnel DT is the difference of the total flow and the dilution air flow. The dilution air flow rate is measured with the flow measurement device FM1, the total flow rate with the flow measurement device of the particulate sampling system. The dilution ratio is calculated from these two flow rates. For sampling with a constant dilution ratio of raw or diluted exhaust gas versus exhaust gas flow (e.g.: secondary dilution for PM sampling), the dilution air flow rate is usually constant and controlled by the flow controller FC1 or dilution air pump.\nThe dilution air (ambient air, synthetic air, or nitrogen) shall be filtered with a high-efficiency PM air (HEPA) filter.\n\nFigure 6.7\n\n\nSchematic of partial flow dilution system (total sampling type).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n=\n\n\nengine exhaust gas or primary diluted flow\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n=\n\n\noptional\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n=\n\n\nPM sampling\n\n\n\n\nComponents of Figure 6.7:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDAF\n\n\n:\n\n\nDilution air filter\n\n\n\n\nDT\n\n\n:\n\n\nDilution tunnel or secondary dilution system\n\n\n\n\nEP\n\n\n:\n\n\nExhaust pipe or primary dilution system\n\n\n\n\nFC1\n\n\n:\n\n\nFlow controller\n\n\n\n\nFH\n\n\n:\n\n\nFilter holder\n\n\n\n\nFM1\n\n\n:\n\n\nFlow measurement device measuring the dilution air flow rate\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\n:\n\n\nSampling pump\n\n\n\n\nPSS\n\n\n:\n\n\nPM sampling system\n\n\n\n\nPTL\n\n\n:\n\n\nPM transfer line\n\n\n\n\nSP\n\n\n:\n\n\nRaw or diluted exhaust gas sampling probe\n\n\n\n\nTL\n\n\n:\n\n\nTransfer line\n\n\n\n\nMass flow rates applicable only for proportional raw exhaust gas sampling PFD:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqm\n\new\n\n\n\nis the exhaust gas mass gas flow rate on wet basis\n\n\n\n\n\nqm\n\naw\n\n\n\nis the intake air mass flow rate on wet basis\n\n\n\n\n\nqm\n\nf\n\n\n\nis the fuel mass flow rate\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dilution\nThe temperature of the diluents (ambient air, synthetic air, or nitrogen as quoted in point 9.2.1) shall be maintained between 293 and 325 K (20 to 52 \u00b0C) in close proximity to the entrance into the dilution tunnel.\nDe-humidifying the dilution air before entering the dilution system is permitted. The partial flow dilution system has to be designed to extract a proportional raw exhaust gas sample from the engine exhaust gas stream, thus responding to excursions in the exhaust gas stream flow rate, and introduce dilution air to this sample to achieve a temperature at the test filter as prescribed by point 9.3.3.4.3. For this it is essential that the dilution ratio be determined such that the accuracy requirements of point 8.1.8.6.1 are fulfilled.\nTo ensure that a flow is measured that corresponds to a measured concentration, either aqueous condensation shall be prevented between the sample probe location and the flow meter inlet in the dilution tunnel or aqueous condensation shall be allowed to occur and humidity at the flow meter inlet measured. The PFD system may be heated or insulated to prevent aqueous condensation. Aqueous condensation shall be prevented throughout the dilution tunnel.\nThe minimum dilution ratio shall be within the range of 5:1 to 7:1 based on the maximum engine exhaust gas flow rate during the test cycle or test interval.\nThe residence time in the system shall be between 0,5 and 5 s, as measured from the point of diluent introduction to the filter holder(s).\nTo determine the mass of the particulates, a particulate sampling system, a particulate sampling filter, a gravimetric balance, and a temperature and humidity controlled weighing chamber, are required.\n9.2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applicability\nPFD may be used to extract a proportional raw exhaust gas sample for any batch or continuous PM and gaseous emission sampling over any transient (NRTC and LSI-NRTC) duty cycle, any discrete-mode NRSC or any RMC duty cycle.\nThe system may be used also for a previously diluted exhaust gas where, via a constant dilution-ratio, an already proportional flow is diluted (see Figure 9.2). This is the way of performing secondary dilution from a CVS tunnel to achieve the necessary overall dilution ratio for PM sampling.\n9.2.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calibration\nThe calibration of the PFD to extract a proportional raw exhaust gas sample is considered in point 8.1.8.6.\n9.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling procedures\n9.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General sampling requirements\n9.3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Probe design and construction\nA probe is the first fitting in a sampling system. It protrudes into a raw or diluted exhaust gas stream to extract a sample, such that it's inside and outside surfaces are in contact with the exhaust gas. A sample is transported out of a probe into a transfer line.\nSample probes shall be made with inside surfaces of stainless steel or, for raw exhaust gas sampling, with any non-reactive material capable of withstanding raw exhaust gas temperatures. Sample probes shall be located where constituents are mixed to their mean sample concentration and where interference with other probes is minimised. It is recommended that all probes remain free from influences of boundary layers, wakes, and eddies \u2014 especially near the outlet of a raw-exhaust meter tailpipe where unintended dilution might occur. Purging or back-flushing of a probe shall not influence another probe during testing. A single probe to extract a sample of more than one constituent may be used as long as the probe meets all the specifications for each constituent.\n9.3.1.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mixing chamber (category NRSh)\nWhere permitted by the manufacturer, a mixing chamber may be used when testing engines of category NRSh. The mixing chamber is an optional component of a raw gas sampling system and is located in the exhaust system between the silencer and the sample probe. The shape and dimensions of the mixing chamber and tubing before and after shall be such that it provides a well-mixed, homogenous sample at the sample probe location and so that strong pulsations or resonances of the chamber influencing the emissions results are avoided.\n9.3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer lines\nTransfer lines that transport an extracted sample from a probe to an analyzer, storage medium, or dilution system shall be minimized in length by locating analyzers, storage media, and dilution systems as close to the probes as practical. The number of bends in transfer lines shall be minimized and that the radius of any unavoidable bend shall be maximized.\n9.3.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling methods\nFor continuous and batch sampling, introduced in point 7.2, the following conditions apply:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nWhen extracting from a constant flow rate, the sample shall also be carried out at a constant flow rate;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nWhen extracting from a varying flow rate, the sample flow rate shall be varied in proportion to the varying flow rate;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nProportional sampling shall be validated as described in point 8.2.1.\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gas sampling\n9.3.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling probes\nEither single-port or multi-port probes are used for sampling gaseous emissions. The probes may be oriented in any direction relative to the raw or diluted exhaust gas flow. For some probes, the sample temperatures shall be controlled, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nFor probes that extract NOx from diluted exhaust gas, the probe's wall temperature shall be controlled to prevent aqueous condensation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFor probes that extract hydrocarbons from the diluted exhaust gas, a probe wall temperature is recommended to be controlled approximately 191 \u00b0C to minimise contamination.\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mixing chamber (Category NRSh)\nWhen used in accordance with point 9.3.1.1.1, the internal volume of the mixing chamber shall not be less than ten times the cylinder displacement of the engine under test. The mixing chamber shall be coupled as closely as possible to the engine silencer and shall have a minimum inner surface temperature of 452 K (179 \u00b0C). The manufacturer may specify the design of the mixing chamber.\n9.3.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer lines\nTransfer lines with inside surfaces of stainless steel, PTFE, VitonTM, or any other material that has better properties for emission sampling shall be used. A non-reactive material capable of withstanding exhaust gas temperatures shall be used. In-line filters may be used if the filter and its housing meet the same temperature requirements as the transfer lines, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nFor NOx transfer lines upstream of either an NO2-to-NO converter that meets the specifications set out in point 8.1.11.5 or a chiller that meets the specifications set out in point 8.1.11.4 a sample temperature that prevents aqueous condensation shall be maintained;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFor THC transfer lines a wall temperature tolerance throughout the entire line of (191 \u00b1 11) \u00b0C shall be maintained. If sampled from raw exhaust gas, an unheated, insulated transfer line may be connected directly to a probe. The length and insulation of the transfer line shall be designed to cool the highest expected raw exhaust gas temperature to no lower than 191 \u00b0C, as measured at the transfer line outlet. For dilute sampling a transition zone between the probe and transfer line of up to 0,92 m in length is allowed to transition the wall temperature to (191 \u00b1 11) \u00b0C.\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample-conditioning components\n9.3.2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample dryers\n9.3.2.3.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Requirements\nSample dryers may be used for removing moisture from the sample in order to decrease the effect of water on gaseous emissions measurement. Sample dryers shall meet the requirements set out in point 9.3.2.3.1.1 and in point 9.3.2.3.1.2. The moisture content 0,8 volume % is used in equation (7-13).\nFor the highest expected water vapour concentration H\nm, the water removal technique shall maintain humidity at \u2264 5 g water\/kg dry air (or about 0,8 volume % H2O), which is 100 % relative humidity at 277,1 K (3,9 \u00b0C) and 101,3 kPa. This humidity specification is equivalent to about 25 % relative humidity at 298 K (25 \u00b0C) and 101,3 kPa. This may be demonstrated by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nmeasuring the temperature at the outlet of the sample dryer;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nmeasuring humidity at a point just upstream of the CLD;\n\n\n\n\nperforming the verification procedure in point 8.1.8.5.8.\n9.3.2.3.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Type of sample dryers allowed and procedure to estimate moisture content after the dryer\nEither type of sample dryer described in this point may be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nIf an osmotic-membrane dryer upstream of any gaseous analyzer or storage medium is used, it shall meet the temperature specifications set out in point 9.3.2.2. The dew point, T\ndew, and absolute pressure, p\ntotal, downstream of an osmotic-membrane dryer shall be monitored. The amount of water shall be calculated as specified in Annex VII by using continuously recorded values of T\ndew and p\ntotal or their peak values observed during a test or their alarm set points. Lacking a direct measurement, the nominal p\ntotal is given by the dryer's lowest absolute pressure expected during testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nA thermal chiller upstream of a THC measurement system for compression-ignition engines may not be used. If a thermal chiller upstream of an NO2-to-NO converter or in a sampling system without an NO2-to-NO converter is used, the chiller shall meet the NO2 loss-performance check specified in point 8.1.11.4. The dew point, T\ndew, and absolute pressure, p\ntotal, downstream of a thermal chiller shall be monitored. The amount of water shall be calculated as specified in Annex VII by using continuously recorded values of T\ndew and p\ntotal or their peak values observed during a test or their alarm set points. Lacking a direct measurement, the nominal p\ntotal is given by the thermal chiller's lowest absolute pressure expected during testing. If it is valid to assume the degree of saturation in the thermal chiller, T\ndew based on the known chiller efficiency and continuous monitoring of chiller temperature, T\nchiller may be calculated. If values of T\nchiller are not continuously recorded, its peak value observed during a test, or its alarm set point, may be used as a constant value to determine a constant amount of water in accordance with Annex VII. If it is valid to assume that T\nchiller is equal to T\ndew, T\nchiller may be used in lieu of T\ndew in accordance with Annex VII. If it is valid to assume a constant temperature offset between T\nchiller and T\ndew, due to a known and fixed amount of sample reheat between the chiller outlet and the temperature measurement location, this assumed temperature offset value may be factored in into emission calculations. The validity of any assumptions allowed by this point shall be shown by engineering analysis or by data.\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample pumps\nSample pumps upstream of an analyzer or storage medium for any gas shall be used. Sample pumps with inside surfaces of stainless steel, PTFE, or any other material having better properties for emission sampling shall be used. For some sample pumps, temperatures shall be controlled, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nIf a NOx sample pump upstream of either an NO2-to-NO converter that meets the requirements set out in point 8.1.11.5 or a chiller that meets the requirements set out in point 8.1.11.4 is used, it shall be heated to prevent aqueous condensation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nIf a THC sample pump upstream of a THC analyzer or storage medium is used, its inner surfaces shall be heated to a tolerance of 464 \u00b1 11 K (191 \u00b1 11) \u00b0C.\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ammonia scrubbers\nAmmonia scrubbers may be used for any or all gaseous sampling systems to prevent NH3 interference, poisoning of NO2-to-NO converter, and deposits in the sampling system or analysers. Installation of the ammonia scrubber shall follow the manufacturer's recommendations.\n9.3.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample storage media\nIn the case of bag sampling, gas volumes shall be stored in sufficiently clean containers that minimally off-gas or allow permeation of gases. Good engineering judgment shall be used to determine acceptable thresholds of storage media cleanliness and permeation. To clean a container, it may be repeatedly purged and evacuated and may be heated. A flexible container (such as a bag) within a temperature-controlled environment, or a temperature controlled rigid container that is initially evacuated or has a volume that can be displaced, such as a piston and cylinder arrangement, shall be used. Containers meeting the specifications in the following Table 6.6 shall be used.\n\nTable 6.6\n\n\nGaseous Batch Sampling Container Materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCO, CO2, O2, CH4, C2H6, C3H8, NO, NO2\n\u00a0(2)\n\n\n\npolyvinyl fluoride (PVF)\u00a0(3) for example TedlarTM, polyvinylidene fluoride\u00a0(3) for example KynarTM, polytetrafluoroethylene\u00a0(4) for example TeflonTM, or stainless steel\u00a0(4)\n\n\n\n\n\nHC\n\n\npolytetrafluoroethylene\u00a0(5) or stainless steel\u00a0(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PM sampling\n9.3.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling probes\nPM probes with a single opening at the end shall be used. PM probes shall be oriented to face directly upstream.\nThe PM probe may be shielded with a hat that conforms with the requirements in Figure 6.8. In this case the pre-classifier described in point 9.3.3.3 shall not be used.\n\nFigure 6.8\n\n\nScheme of a sampling probe with a hat-shaped pre-classifier\n\n\n\n\n9.3.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transfer lines\nInsulated or heated transfer lines or a heated enclosure are recommended to minimize temperature differences between transfer lines and exhaust gas constituents. Transfer lines that are inert with respect to PM and are electrically conductive on the inside surfaces shall be used. It is recommended using PM transfer lines made of stainless steel; any material other than stainless steel will be required to meet the same sampling performance as stainless steel. The inside surface of PM transfer lines shall be electrically grounded.\n9.3.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pre-classifier\nThe use of a PM pre-classifier to remove large-diameter particles is permitted that is installed in the dilution system directly before the filter holder. Only one pre-classifier is permitted. If a hat shaped probe is used (see Figure 6.8), the use of a pre-classifier is prohibited.\nThe PM pre-classifier may be either an inertial impactor or a cyclonic separator. It shall be constructed of stainless steel. The pre-classifier shall be rated to remove at least 50 % of PM at an aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u03bcm and no more than 1 % of PM at an aerodynamic diameter of 1 \u03bcm over the range of flow rates for which it is used. The pre-classifier outlet shall be configured with a means of bypassing any PM sample filter so that the pre-classifier flow can be stabilized before starting a test. PM sample filter shall be located within 75 cm downstream of the pre-classifier's exit.\n9.3.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample filter\nThe diluted exhaust gas shall be sampled by a filter that meets the requirements set out in points 9.3.3.4.1 to 9.3.3.4.4 during the test sequence.\n9.3.3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filter specification\nAll filter types shall have a collection efficiency of at least 99,7 %. The sample filter manufacturer's measurements reflected in their product ratings may be used to show this requirement. The filter material shall be either:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nFluorocarbon (PTFE) coated glass fibre; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFluorocarbon (PTFE) membrane.\n\n\n\n\nIf the expected net PM mass on the filter exceeds 400 \u03bcg, a filter with a minimum initial collection efficiency of 98 % may be used.\n9.3.3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filter size\nThe nominal filter size shall be 46,50 mm \u00b1 0,6 mm diameter (at least 37 mm stain diameter). Larger diameter filters may be used with prior agreement of the approval authority. Proportionality between filter and stain area is recommended.\n9.3.3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dilution and temperature control of PM samples\nPM samples shall be diluted at least once upstream of transfer lines in case of a CVS system and downstream in case of PFD system (see point 9.3.3.2 relating to transfer lines). Sample temperature shall be controlled to a 320 \u00b1 5 K (47 \u00b1 5 \u00b0C) tolerance, as measured anywhere within 200 mm upstream or 200 mm downstream of the PM storage media. The PM sample is intended to be heated or cooled primarily by dilution conditions as specified in point 9.2.1(a).\n9.3.3.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filter face velocity\nA filter face velocity shall be between 0,90 and 1,00 m\/s with less than 5 % of the recorded flow values exceeding this range. If the total PM mass exceeds 400 \u03bcg, the filter face velocity may be reduced. The face velocity shall be measured as the volumetric flow rate of the sample at the pressure upstream of the filter and temperature of the filter face, divided by the filter's exposed area. The exhaust system stack or CVS tunnel pressure shall be used for the upstream pressure if the pressure drop through the PM sampler up to the filter is less than 2 kPa.\n9.3.3.4.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filter holder\nTo minimize turbulent deposition and to deposit PM evenly on a filter, a 12,5\u00b0 (from centre) divergent cone angle to transition from the transfer-line inside diameter to the exposed diameter of the filter face shall be used. Stainless steel for this transition shall be used.\n9.3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PM-stabilization and weighing environments for gravimetric analysis\n9.3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Environment for gravimetric analysis\nThis section describes the two environments required to stabilize and weigh PM for gravimetric analysis: the PM stabilization environment, where filters are stored before weighing; and the weighing environment, where the balance is located. The two environments may share a common space.\nBoth the stabilization and the weighing environments shall be kept free of ambient contaminants, such as dust, aerosols, or semi-volatile material that could contaminate PM samples.\n9.3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cleanliness\nThe cleanliness of the PM-stabilization environment using reference filters shall be verified, as described in point 8.1.12.1.4.\n9.3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Temperature of the chamber\nThe temperature of the chamber (or room) in which the particulate filters are conditioned and weighed shall be maintained to within 295 \u00b1 1 K (22 \u00b0C \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) during all filter conditioning and weighing. The humidity shall be maintained to a dew point of 282,5 \u00b1 1 K (9,5 \u00b0C \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) and a relative humidity of 45 % \u00b1 8 %. If the stabilization and weighing environments are separate, the stabilization environment shall be maintained at a tolerance of 295 \u00b1 3 K (22 \u00b0C \u00b1 3 \u00b0C).\n9.3.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verification of ambient conditions\nWhen using measurement instruments that meet the specifications in point 9.4 the following ambient conditions shall be verified:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nDew point and ambient temperature shall be recorded. These values shall be used to determine if the stabilization and weighing environments have remained within the tolerances specified in point 9.3.4.3 for at least 60 min before weighing filters;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nAtmospheric pressure shall be continuously recorded within the weighing environment.

However, any system meeting the performance specifications in points 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 is acceptable.\nFigures 6.9 and 6.10 are schematic drawings of the recommended particle sampling system configures for partial and full flow dilution systems respectively.\n\nFigure 6.9\n\n\nSchematic of recommended particle sampling system \u2014 Partial flow sampling\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10\n\n\nSchematic of recommended particle sampling system \u2014 Full flow sampling\n\n\n2.1.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sampling system description\nThe particle sampling system shall consist of a sampling probe tip or particle sampling point in the dilution system, a particle transfer tube (PTT), a particle pre-classifier (PCF) and a volatile particle remover (VPR) upstream of the particle number concentration measurement (PNC) unit. The VPR shall include devices for sample dilution (particle number diluters: PND1 and PND2) and particle evaporation (Evaporation tube, ET). The sampling probe or sampling point for the test gas flow shall be so arranged within the dilution tract that a representative sample gas flow is taken from a homogeneous diluent\/exhaust gas mixture. The sum of the residence time of the system plus the response time of the PNC shall be no greater than 20 s.\n2.1.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Particle transfer system\nThe sampling probe tip or particle sampling point and Particle Transfer Tube (PTT) together comprise the Particle Transfer System (PTS). The PTS conducts the sample from the dilution tunnel to the entrance to the first particle number diluter. The PTS shall meet the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the case of full flow dilution systems and partial flow dilution systems of the fractional sampling type (as described in point 9.2.3 of this Annex) the sampling probe shall be installed near the tunnel centre line, 10 to 20 tunnel diameters downstream of the gas inlet, facing upstream into the tunnel gas flow with its axis at the tip parallel to that of the dilution tunnel. The sampling probe shall be positioned within the dilution tract so that the sample is taken from a homogeneous diluent\/exhaust gas mixture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the case of partial flow dilution systems of the total sampling type (as described in point 9.2.3 of this Annex) the particle sampling point shall be located in the particulate transfer tube, upstream of the particulate filter holder, flow measurement device and any sample\/bypass bifurcation point. The sampling point or sampling probe shall be positioned so that the sample is taken from a homogeneous diluent\/exhaust gas mixture.\n\n\n\n\nSample gas drawn through the PTS shall meet the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt shall have a flow Reynolds number (Re) of < 1\u00a0700;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt shall have a residence time in the PTS of \u2264 3 seconds.\n\n\n\n\nAny other sampling configuration for the PTS for which equivalent particle penetration for particles of 30 nm electrical mobility diameter can be demonstrated will be considered acceptable.\nThe outlet tube (OT) conducting the diluted sample from the VPR to the inlet of the PNC shall have the following properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt shall have an internal diameter of \u2265 4 mm;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSample gas flow through the POT shall have a residence time of \u2264 0,8 second.\n\n\n\n\nAny other sampling configuration for the OT for which equivalent particle penetration for particles of 30 nm electrical mobility diameter can be demonstrated will be considered acceptable.\n2.1.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Particle pre-classifier\nThe recommended particle pre-classifier shall be located upstream of the VPR. The pre-classifier 50 % cut point particle diameter shall be between 2,5 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm at the volumetric flow rate selected for sampling particle number emissions. The pre-classifier shall allow at least 99 % of the mass concentration of 1 \u03bcm particles entering the pre-classifier to pass through the exit of the pre-classifier at the volumetric flow rate selected for sampling particle number emissions. In the case of partial flow dilution systems, it is acceptable to use the same pre-classifier for particulate mass and particle number sampling, extracting the particle number sample from the dilution system downstream of the pre-classifier. Alternatively separate pre-classifiers may be used, extracting the particle number sample from the dilution system upstream of the particulate mass pre-classifier.\n2.1.4.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Volatile particle remover (VPR)\nThe VPR shall comprise one particle number diluter (PND1), an evaporation tube and a second diluter (PND2) in series. This dilution function is to reduce the number concentration of the sample entering the particle concentration measurement unit to less than the upper threshold of the single particle count mode of the PNC and to suppress nucleation within the sample. The VPR shall provide an indication of whether or not PND1 and the evaporation tube are at their correct operating temperatures.\nThe VPR shall achieve > 99,0 % vaporisation of 30 nm tetracontane (CH3(CH2)38CH3) particles, with an inlet concentration of \u2265 10\u00a0000 cm\u2013 3, by means of heating and reduction of partial pressures of the tetracontane. It shall also achieve a particle concentration reduction factor (fr\n) for particles of 30 nm and 50 nm electrical mobility diameters, that is no more than 30 % and 20 % respectively higher, and no more than 5 % lower than that for particles of 100 nm electrical mobility diameter for the VPR as a whole.\n2.1.4.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First particle number dilution device (PND1)\nThe first particle number dilution device shall be specifically designed to dilute particle number concentration and operate at a (wall) temperature of 423 K to 673 K (150 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C). The wall temperature set point should be held at a constant nominal operating temperature, within this range, to a tolerance of \u00b1 10 \u00b0C and not exceed the wall temperature of the ET (point 2.1.4.4.2). The diluter should be supplied with HEPA filtered dilution air and be capable of a dilution factor of 10 to 200 times.\n2.1.4.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evaporation Tube (ET)\nThe entire length of the ET shall be controlled to a wall temperature greater than or equal to that of the first particle number dilution device and the wall temperature held at a fixed nominal operating temperature between 300 \u00b0C and 400 \u00b0C, to a tolerance of \u00b1 10 \u00b0C.\n2.1.4.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second particle number dilution device (PND2)\nPND2 shall be specifically designed to dilute particle number concentration.

These points will include a nominal zero concentration point produced by attaching HEPA filters of at least class H13 of EN 1822:2008, or equivalent performance, to the inlet of each instrument. With no calibration factor applied to the PNC under calibration, measured concentrations shall be within \u00b1 10 % of the standard concentration for each concentration used, with the exception of the zero point, otherwise the PNC under calibration shall be rejected. The gradient from a linear regression of the two data sets shall be calculated and recorded. A calibration factor equal to the reciprocal of the gradient shall be applied to the PNC under calibration. Linearity of response is calculated as the square of the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (R2) of the two data sets and shall be equal to or greater than 0,97. In calculating both the gradient and R2 the linear regression shall be forced through the origin (zero concentration on both instruments).\nIn the reference PNC case, calibration shall be undertaken using at least six standard concentrations across the PNC's measurement range. At least 3 points shall be at concentrations below 1\u00a0000 cm\u2013 3, the remaining concentrations shall be linearly spaced between 1\u00a0000 cm\u2013 3 and the maximum of the PNC's range in single particle count mode.

The periodic validation requirement for the VPR's particle concentration reduction factor is limited to a check at a single setting, typical of that used for measurement on diesel particulate filter equipped non-road mobile machinery. The Technical Service shall ensure the existence of a calibration or validation certificate for the volatile particle remover within a 6-month period prior to the emissions test. If the volatile particle remover incorporates temperature monitoring alarms a 12 month validation interval shall be permissible.\nThe VPR shall be characterised for particle concentration reduction factor with solid particles of 30 nm, 50 nm and 100 nm electrical mobility diameter. Particle concentration reduction factors (\u0192r\n(d)) for particles of 30 nm and 50 nm electrical mobility diameters shall be no more than 30 % and 20 % higher respectively, and no more than 5 % lower than that for particles of 100 nm electrical mobility diameter. For the purposes of validation, the mean particle concentration reduction factor shall be within \u00b1 10 % of the mean particle concentration reduction factor () determined during the primary calibration of the VPR.\n2.2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The test aerosol for these measurements shall be solid particles of 30, 50 and 100 nm electrical mobility diameter and a minimum concentration of 5\u00a0000 particles cm\u2013 3 at the VPR inlet.

In addition, the sampling line shall be as short as practically possible.\n2.1.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cross interference\nThe spectral resolution of the NH3 wavelength shall be within 0,5 cm\u2013 1 in order to minimize cross interference from other gases present in the exhaust gas.\n2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Non Dispersive Ultra Violet Resonance Absorption analyser (hereinafter \u2018NDUV\u2019)\n2.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement Principle\nThe NDUV is based on a purely physical principle, no auxiliary gases or equipment is necessary. The main element of the photometer is an electrode-less discharge lamp. It produces a sharply structured radiation in the ultraviolet range, enabling the measurement of several components such as NH3.\nThe photometric system has a dual beam in time design set up to produce a measuring and a reference beam by filter correlation technique.\nIn order to achieve a high stability of the measuring signal the dual beam in time design is combined with a dual beam in space design. The detector signals processing fosters an almost negligible amount of zero point drift rate.\nIn the calibration mode of the analyser a sealed-off quartz cell is tilted into the beam path to obtain an exact calibration value, since any reflection and absorption losses of the cell windows are compensated. Since the gas filling of the cell is very stable, this calibration method leads to a very high long term stability of the photometer.\n2.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Installation\nThe analyser shall be installed within an analyser cabinet using extractive sampling in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's instructions. The analyzer location shall be capable of supporting the weight specified by the manufacturer.\nThe sample path (sampling line, pre-filter(s) and valves) shall be made of stainless steel or PTFE and shall be heated to set points between 383 K (110 \u00b0C) and 464 K (191 \u00b0C).\nIn addition, the sampling line shall be as short as possible. Influence from exhaust gas temperature and pressure, installation environment and vibrations on the measurement shall be minimized.\nThe gas analyzer shall be protected from cold, heat, temperature variations, and strong air currents, accumulation of dust, corrosive atmosphere and vibrations. Adequate air circulation shall be provided to avoid heat build-up. The complete surface shall be used to dissipate the heat losses.\n2.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cross Sensitivity\nAn appropriate spectral range shall be chosen in order to minimize cross interferences of accompanying gases. Typical components causing cross sensitivities on the NH3 measurement are SO2, NO2 and NO.\nAdditionally, further methods can be applied to reduce the cross sensitivities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nUsage of interference filters;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nCross sensitivity compensation by measuring cross sensitivity components and using the measurement signal for compensation.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laser Infrared analyser\n2.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement principle\nAn infrared laser such as a tunable diode laser (TDL) or a quantum cascade laser (QCL) can emit coherent light in the near-infrared region or in mid-infrared region respectively where nitrogen compounds including NH3 have strong absorption. This laser optics can give a pulsed-mode high resolution narrow band near-infrared or mid-infrared spectrum. Therefore, laser infrared analyzers can reduce interference caused by the spectral overlap of co-existing components in engine exhaust gas.\n2.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Installation\nThe analyser shall be installed either directly in the exhaust pipe (in-situ) or within an analyser cabinet using extractive sampling in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's instructions. If installed in an analyser cabinet, the sample path (sampling line, pre-filter(s) and valves) shall be made of stainless steel or PTFE and shall be heated to set points between 383 K (110 \u00b0C) and 464 K (191 \u00b0C) in order to minimize NH3 losses and sampling artefacts. In addition, the sampling line shall be as short as practically possible.\nInfluence from exhaust gas temperature and pressure, installation environment and vibrations on the measurement shall be minimized, or compensation techniques be used.\nIf applicable, sheath air used in conjunction with in-situ measurement for protection of the instrument, shall not affect the concentration of any exhaust gas component measured downstream of the device, or sampling of other exhaust gas components shall be made upstream of the device.\n2.3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interference verification for NH3 laser infrared analyzers (cross interference)\n2.3.3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scope and frequency\nIf NH3 is measured using laser infrared analyser, the amount of interference shall be verified after initial analyser installation and after major maintenance.\n2.3.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement principles for interference verification\nInterference gasses can positively interfere with certain laser infrared analyzer by causing a response similar to NH3. If the analyzer uses compensation algorithms that utilize measurements of other gases to meet this interference verification, these other measurements shall be simultaneously conducted to test the compensation algorithms during the analyzer interference verification.\nGood engineering judgment shall be used to determine interference gases for laser infrared analyzer. Note that interference species, with the exception of H2O, are dependent on the NH3 infrared absorption band chosen by the instrument manufacturer. For each analyzer the NH3 infrared absorption band shall be determined. For each NH3 infrared absorption band, good engineering judgment shall be used to determine interference gases to use in the verification.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Emissions test procedure\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Checking the analysers\nPrior to the emissions test, the analyser range shall be selected. Emission analysers with automatic or manual range switching shall be permitted. During the test cycle, the range of the analysers shall not be switched.\nZero and span response shall be determined, if the provisions set out in point 3.4.2 do not apply for the instrument. For the span response, a NH3 gas that meets the specifications set out in point 4.2.7, shall be used. The use of reference cells that contain NH3 span gas is permitted.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection of emission relevant data\nAt the start of the test sequence, the NH3 data collection shall be started, simultaneously. The NH3 concentration shall be measured continuously and stored with at least 1 Hz on a computer system.\n3.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Operations after test\nAt the completion of the test, sampling shall continue until system response times have elapsed. Determination of analyser's drift in accordance with point 3.4.1 shall only be required if the information required in point 3.4.2 is not available.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analyser drift\n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as practical but no later than 30 minutes after the test cycle is complete or during the soak period, the zero and span responses of the analyser shall be determined. The difference between the pre-test and post-test results shall be less than 2 %t of full scale.\n3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determination of analyser drift is not required in the following situations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nIf the zero and span drift specified by the instrument manufacturer in points 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 meets the requirements of point 3.4.1;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe time interval for zero and span drift specified by the instrument manufacturer in points 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 exceeds the duration of the test.\n\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analyser specification and verification\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Linearity requirements\nThe analyser shall comply with the linearity requirements specified in Table 6.5 of this Annex. The linearity verification in accordance with point 8.1.4 of this Annex shall be performed at least at the minimum frequency set out in Table 6.4 of this Annex. With the prior approval of the approval authority, less than 10 reference points are permitted, if an equivalent accuracy can be demonstrated.\nFor the linearity verification, a NH3 gas that meets the specifications set out in point 4.2.7 shall be used. The use of reference cells that contain NH3 span gas shall be permitted.\nInstruments, whose signals are used for compensation algorithms, shall meet the linearity requirements specified in Table 6.5 of this Annex. Linearity verification shall be done as required by internal audit procedures, by the instrument manufacturer or in accordance with ISO 9000 requirements.\n4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Analyser specifications\nThe analyser shall have a measuring range and response time appropriate for the accuracy required to measure the concentration of NH3 under transient and steady state conditions.\n4.2.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Minimum detection limit\nThe analyser shall have a minimum detection limit of < 2 ppm under all conditions of testing.\n4.2.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accuracy\nThe accuracy, defined as the deviation of the analyser reading from the reference value, shall not exceed \u00b1 3 % of the reading or \u00b1 2 ppm, whichever is larger.\n4.2.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zero drift\nThe drift of the zero response and the related time interval shall be specified by the instrument manufacturer.\n4.2.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Span drift\nThe drift of the span response and the related time interval shall be specified by the instrument manufacturer.\n4.2.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0System response time\nThe system response time shall be \u2264 20 s.\n4.2.6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rise time\nThe rise time of the analyser shall be \u2264 5 s.\n4.2.7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NH3 calibration gas\nA gas mixture with the following chemical composition shall be available.\nNH3 and purified nitrogen.\nThe true concentration of the calibration gas shall be within \u00b1 3 % of the nominal value. The concentration of NH3 shall be given on a volume basis (volume per cent or volume ppm).\nThe expiration date of the calibration gases stated by the manufacturer shall be recorded.\n4.2.8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interference verification procedure\nThe interference verification shall be performed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe NH3 analyzer shall be started, operated, zeroed, and spanned as it would be before an emission test;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nA humidified interference test gas shall be created by bubbling a multi component span gas through distilled H2O in a sealed vessel. If the sample is not passed through a sample dryer, the vessel temperature shall be controlled to generate an H2O level at least as high as the maximum expected during emission testing. Interference span gas concentrations shall be used at least as high as the maximum expected during testing;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nThe humidified interference test gas shall be introduced into the sample system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nThe water mole fraction, x\nH2O, of the humidified interference test gas shall be measured, as close as possible to the inlet of the analyzer. For example, dew point, T\ndew, and absolute pressure, p\ntotal, shall be measured to calculate x\nH2O;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)\n\n\nGood engineering judgment shall be used to prevent condensation in the transfer lines, fittings, or valves from the point where x\nH2O is measured to the analyzer;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f)\n\n\nTime shall be allowed for the analyser response to stabilize;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(g)\n\n\nWhile the analyser measures the sample's concentration, its output shall be recorded for 30 s. The arithmetic mean of this data shall be calculated;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(h)\n\n\nThe analyzer meets the interference verification if the result of paragraph (g) of this point meets the tolerance in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nInterference procedures for individual interference gases may also run separately. If the interference gas levels used are higher than the maximum levels expected during testing, each observed interference value may be scaled down by multiplying the observed interference by the ratio of the maximum expected concentration value to the actual value used during this procedure. Separate interference concentrations of H2O (down to 0,025 mol\/mol H2O content) that are lower than the maximum levels expected during testing may be run, but the observed H2O interference shall be scaled up by multiplying the observed interference by the ratio of the maximum expected H2O concentration value to the actual value used during this procedure. The sum of the scaled interference values must meet the tolerance for combined interference as specified in paragraph (j) of this point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(j)\n\n\nAnalyzer shall have combined interference within \u00b1 2 % of the flow-weighted mean concentration of NH3 expected at the emission limit.\n\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alternative systems\nOther systems or analysers may be approved by the approval authority, if it is found that they yield equivalent results in accordance with point 5.1.1 of this Annex.

The flow through the system shall be measured at different restriction settings, and the control parameters of the system shall be measured and related to the flow.\nVarious types of flowmeters may be used, e.g. calibrated venturi, calibrated laminar flowmeter, calibrated turbine meter.\n2.5.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Positive displacement pump (PDP)\nAll the parameters related to the pump shall be simultaneously measured along with the parameters related to a calibration venturi which is connected in series with the pump. The calculated flow rate (in m3\/s at pump inlet, absolute pressure and temperature) shall be plotted versus a correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of pump parameters. The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function shall be determined. If a CVS has a multiple speed drive, the calibration shall be performed for each range used.\nTemperature stability shall be maintained during calibration.\nLeaks in all the connections and ducting between the calibration venturi and the CVS pump shall be maintained lower than 0,3 % of the lowest flow point (highest restriction and lowest PDP speed point).\nThe airflow rate (qV\n\nCVS) at each restriction setting (minimum 6 settings) shall be calculated in standard m3\/s from the flowmeter data using the manufacturer's prescribed method. The airflow rate shall then be converted to pump flow (V\n0) in m3\/rev at absolute pump inlet temperature and pressure by means of equation (7-69):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7-69)\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqV\n\nCVS\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nairflow rate at standard conditions (101,325 kPa, 273,15 K) [m3\/s]\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n=\n\n\ntemperature at pump inlet [K]\n\n\n\n\n\np\np\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nabsolute pressure at pump inlet [kPa]\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n=\n\n\npump speed [rev\/s]\n\n\n\n\nTo account for the interaction of pressure variations at the pump and the pump slip rate, the correlation function (X\n0) [s\/rev] between pump speed, pressure differential from pump inlet to pump outlet and absolute pump outlet pressure shall be calculated by means of equation (7-70):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7-70)\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394p\np\n\n\n\n=\n\n\npressure differential from pump inlet to pump outlet [kPa]\n\n\n\n\n\np\np\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nabsolute outlet pressure at pump outlet [kPa]\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n=\n\n\npump speed [rev\/s]\n\n\n\n\nA linear least-square fit shall be performed to generate the calibration by means of equation (7-71):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n0 = D\n0 \u2013m \u0387 X\n0\n\n\n\n(7-71)\n\n\n\n\nwith D\n0 [m3\/rev] and m [m3\/s], intercept and slope respectively, describing the regression line.\nFor a CVS system with multiple speeds, the calibration curves generated for the different pump flow ranges shall be approximately parallel, and the intercept values (D\n0) shall increase as the pump flow range decreases.\nThe calculated values from the equation shall be within \u00b1 0,5 % of the measured value of V\n0. Values of m will vary from one pump to another. Particulate influx over time will cause the pump slip to decrease, as reflected by lower values for m. Therefore, calibration shall be performed at pump start-up, after major maintenance, and if the total system verification indicates a change of the slip rate.\n2.5.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Critical flow venturi (CFV)\nCalibration of the CFV is based upon the flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow is a function of venturi inlet pressure and temperature.\nTo determine the range of critical flow, K\nV shall be plotted as a function of venturi inlet pressure. For critical (choked) flow, K\nV will have a relatively constant value. As pressure decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and K\nV decreases, which indicates that the CFV is operated outside the permissible range.\nThe airflow rate (qV\n\nCVS) at each restriction setting (minimum 8 settings) shall be calculated in standard m3\/s from the flowmeter data using the manufacturer's prescribed method.

A flow-weighted mean is the mean of a quantity after it is weighted proportional to a corresponding flow rate. For example, if a gas concentration is measured continuously from the raw exhaust gas of an engine, its flow-weighted mean concentration is the sum of the products of each recorded concentration times its respective exhaust gas molar flow rate, divided by the sum of the recorded flow rate values. As another example, the bag concentration from a CVS system is the same as the flow-weighted mean concentration because the CVS system itself flow-weights the bag concentration. A certain flow-weighted mean concentration of an emission at its standard might be already expected based on previous testing with similar engines or testing with similar equipment and instruments.\n3.4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chemical balances of fuel, intake air, and exhaust gas\n3.4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General\nChemical balances of fuel, intake air and exhaust gas may be used to calculate flows, the amount of water in their flows, and the wet concentration of constituents in their flows. With one flow rate of either fuel, intake air or exhaust gas, chemical balances may be used to determine the flows of the other two. For example, chemical balances along with either intake air or fuel flow to determine raw exhaust gas flow may be used.\n3.4.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Procedures that require chemical balances\nChemical balances are required to determine the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe amount of water in a raw or diluted exhaust gas flow, x\nH2Oexh, when the amount of water to correct for the amount of water removed by a sampling system is not measured;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nThe flow-weighted mean fraction of dilution air in diluted exhaust gas, x\ndil\/exh, when dilution air flow is not measured to correct for background emissions. It has to be noted that if chemical balances are used for this purpose, the exhaust gas is assumed to be stoichiometric, even if it is not.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chemical balance procedure\nThe calculations for a chemical balance involve a system of equations that require iteration. The initial values of up to three quantities shall be guessed: the amount of water in the measured flow, x\nH2Oexh, fraction of dilution air in diluted exhaust gas (or excess air in the raw exhaust gas), x\ndil\/exh, and the amount of products on a C1 basis per dry mole of dry measured flow, x\nCcombdry. Time-weighted mean values of combustion air humidity and dilution air humidity in the chemical balance may be used; as long as combustion air and dilution air humidity remain within tolerances of \u00b1 0,0025 mol\/mol of their respective mean values over the test interval. For each emission concentration, x, and amount of water x\nH2Oexh, their completely dry concentrations, x\ndry and x\nH2Oexhdry shall be determined. The fuel atomic hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, \u03b1, oxygen-to-carbon ratio, \u03b2 and carbon mass fraction of fuel, w\nC shall also be used. For the test fuel, \u03b1 and \u03b2 or the default values in Table 7.3 may be used.\nUse the following steps to complete a chemical balance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nMeasured concentrations such as, x\nCO2meas, x\nNOmeas, and x\nH2Oint, shall be converted to dry concentrations by dividing them by one minus the amount of water present during their respective measurements; for example: x\nH2OxCO2meas, x\nH2OxNOmeas, and x\nH2Oint. If the amount of water present during a \u2018wet\u2019 measurement is the same as the unknown amount of water in the exhaust gas flow, x\nH2Oexh, it has to be iteratively solved for that value in the system of equations. If only total NOx are measured and not NO and NO2 separately, good engineering judgement shall be used to estimate a split in the total NOx concentration between NO and NO2 for the chemical balances. The molar concentration of NOx, x\nNOx, may be assumed to be 75 % NO and 25 % NO2. For NO2 storage after-treatment systems, x\nNOx may be assumed to be 25 % NO and 75 % NO2. For calculating the mass of NOx emissions, the molar mass of NO2 for the effective molar mass of all NOx species, regardless of the actual NO2 fraction of NOx, shall be used;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nEquations (7-82) to (7-99) in paragraph (d) of this point have to be entered into a computer program to iteratively solve for x\nH2Oexh, x\nCcombdry and x\ndil\/exh. Good engineering judgment shall be used to guess initial values for x\nH2Oexh, x\nCcombdry, and x\ndil\/exh. Guessing an initial amount of water that is about twice the amount of water in the intake or dilution air is recommended. Guessing an initial value of x\nCcombdry as the sum of the measured CO2, CO, and THC values is recommended. Guessing an initial x\ndil between 0,75 and 0,95, such as 0,8 is also recommended.

Because a subsonic venturi (SSV) and a critical-flow venturi (CFV) both operate similarly, their governing equations are nearly the same, except for the equation describing their pressure ratio, r (i.e., r\nSSV versus r\nCFV). These governing equations assume one-dimensional isentropic inviscid compressible flow of an ideal gas. In point 3.9.3(d), other assumptions that may be made are described. If the assumption of an ideal gas for the measured flow is not allowed, the governing equations include a first-order correction for the behaviour of a real gas; namely, the compressibility factor, Z. If good engineering judgment dictates using a value other than Z = 1, an appropriate equation of state to determine values of Z as a function of measured pressures and temperatures may be used, or specific calibration equations may be developed based on good engineering judgment. It shall be noted that the equation for the flow coefficient, C\nf, is based on the ideal gas assumption that the isentropic exponent, \u03b3, is equal to the ratio of specific heats, cp\n\/c\nV\n. If good engineering judgment dictates using a real gas isentropic exponent, an appropriate equation of state to determine values of \u03b3 as a function of measured pressures and temperatures may be used, or specific calibration equations may be developed.

To determine the C\nd for a single venturi or a single combination of venturis, the following steps shall be performed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i)\n\n\nWith the data collected at each calibration set point an individual C\nd for each point shall be calculated using equation (7-140);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(ii)\n\n\nThe mean and standard deviation of all the C\nd values shall be calculated in accordance with equations (7-155) and (7-156);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii)\n\n\nIf the standard deviation of all the C\nd values is less than or equal to 0,3 % of the mean C\nd, then the mean C\nd shall be used in equation (7-120), and the CFV shall be used only down to the lowest r measured during calibration;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr= 1 \u2013 (\u0394p\/pin\n)\n\n\n(7-148)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(iv)\n\n\nIf the standard deviation of all the C\nd values exceeds 0,3 % of the mean C\nd, the C\nd values corresponding to the data point collected at the lowest r measured during calibration shall be omitted;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(v)\n\n\nIf the number of remaining data points is less than seven, corrective action shall be taken by checking calibration data or repeating the calibration process.

The calculations correct the gas analyzer's responses that were recorded during a test interval. The correction is based on an analyzer's mean responses to reference zero and span gases, and it is based on the reference concentrations of the zero and span gases themselves. Validation and correction for drift shall be performed as follows:\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drift validation\n\nAfter applying all the other corrections\u2013except drift correction\u2013to all the gas analyzer signals, brake-specific emissions shall be calculated in accordance with point 3.8.

However, in some cases it might be known that x\nrefzero has a non-zero concentration. For example, if a CO2 analyzer is zeroed using ambient air, the default ambient air concentration of CO2, which is 375 \u03bcmol\/mol, may be used. In this case, x\nrefzero = 375 \u03bcmol\/mol. When an analyzer is zeroed using a non-zero x\nrefzero, the analyzer shall be set to output the actual xrefzero concentration. For example, if x\nrefzero = 375 \u03bcmol\/mol, the analyzer shall be set to output a value of 375 \u03bcmol\/mol when the zero gas is flowing to the analyzer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 2\n\nCarbon Flow Check\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction\n\nAll but a tiny part of the carbon in the exhaust gas comes from the fuel, and all but a minimal part of this is manifest in the exhaust gas as CO2. This is the basis for a system verification check based on CO2 measurements. In the case of SI engines without control of excess air ratio \u03bb or SI engines operating outside the range 0,97 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1,03, the procedure shall additionally include measurement of HC and CO.\nThe flow of carbon into the exhaust gas measurement systems is determined from the fuel flow rate. The flow of carbon at various sampling points in the emissions and particulate sampling systems is determined from the CO2 (or CO2, HC and CO) concentrations and gas flow rates at those points.\nIn this sense, the engine provides a known source of carbon flow, and observing the same carbon flow in the exhaust pipe and at the outlet of the partial flow PM sampling system verifies leak integrity and flow measurement accuracy. This check has the advantage that the components are operating under actual engine test conditions of temperature and flow.\nFigure 7.1 shows the sampling points at which the carbon flows shall be checked. The specific equations for the carbon flows at each of the sample points are given in the following points.\n\nFigure 7.1\n\n\nMeasuring points for carbon flow check\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carbon flow rate into the engine (location 1)\n\nThe carbon mass flow rate into the engine qm\n\nCf [kg\/s] for a fuel CH\u03b1O\u03b5 shall be calculated by means of equation (7-150):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7-150)\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqm\n\nf\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nfuel mass flow rate [kg\/s]\n\n\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carbon flow rate in the raw exhaust gas (location 2)\n\n3.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on CO2\n\nThe carbon mass flow rate in the exhaust pipe of the engine qm\n\nCe [kg\/s] shall be determined from the raw CO2 concentration and the exhaust gas mass flow rate by means of equation (7-151):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7-151)\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nCO2,r\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nwet CO2 concentration in the raw exhaust gas [%]\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nCO2,a\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nwet CO2 concentration in the ambient air [%]\n\n\n\n\n\nqm\n\new\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nexhaust gas mass flow rate on wet basis [kg\/s]\n\n\n\n\n\nM\ne\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nmolar mass of exhaust gas [g\/mol]\n\n\n\n\nIf CO2 is measured on a dry basis it shall be converted to a wet basis in accordance with point 2.1.3 or point 3.5.2.\n3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on CO2, HC and CO\nAs an alternative to performing the calculation solely based upon CO2 in point 3.1, the carbon mass flow rate in the exhaust pipe of the engine qm\n\nCe [kg\/s] shall be determined from the raw CO2, HC and CO concentration and the exhaust gas mass flow rate by means of equation (7-152):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7-152)\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nCO2,r\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nwet CO2 concentration in the raw exhaust gas [%]\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nCO2,a\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nwet CO2 concentration in the ambient air [%]\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nTHC(C1),r\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nTHC(C1) concentration in the raw exhaust gas [%]\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nTHC(C1),a\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nTHC(C1) concentration in the ambient air [%]\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nCO,r\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nwet CO concentration in the raw exhaust gas [%]\n\n\n\n\n\nc\nCO,a\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nwet CO concentration in the ambient air [%]\n\n\n\n\n\nqm\n\new\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nexhaust gas mass flow rate on wet basis [kg\/s]\n\n\n\n\n\nM\ne\n\n\n\n=\n\n\nmolar mass of exhaust gas [g\/mol]\n\n\n\n\nIf CO2 or CO are measured on a dry basis they shall be converted to a wet basis in accordance with point 2.1.3 or point 3.5.2.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carbon flow rate in the dilution system (location 3)\n\n4.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Based on CO2\n\nFor the partial flow dilution system, the splitting ratio also needs to be taken into account.

In the case that no additional requirement or exception is listed, the requirements of this Regulation shall apply to dual-fuel engines in the same way as they apply to any other approved engine types or engine families under Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628.\nEmission testing of a dual-fuel engine is complicated by the fact that the fuel used by the engine can vary between pure liquid fuel and a combination of mainly gaseous fuel with only a small amount of liquid fuel as an ignition source. The ratio between the fuels used by a dual-fuel engine can also change dynamically depending of the operating condition of the engine. As a result special precautions and restrictions are necessary to enable emission testing of these engines.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Test conditions\n\nSection 6 of Annex VI shall apply.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Test procedures\n\nSection 7 of Annex VI shall apply.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement procedures\n\nSection 8 of Annex VI shall apply except as set out in this Appendix.\nA full-flow dilution measurement procedure for dual-fuel engines is illustrated in Figure 6.6 of Annex VI (CVS system).\nThis measurement procedure ensures that the variation of the fuel composition during the test will mainly influence the hydrocarbon measurement results. This shall be compensated via one of the methods described in point 5.1.\nRaw gaseous\/partial flow measurement illustrated in Figure 6.7 of Annex VI may be used with some precautions regarding exhaust gas mass flow determination and calculation methods.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measurement equipment\n\nSection 9 of Annex VI shall apply.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Particle number emissions measurement\n\nAppendix 1 of Annex VI shall apply.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Emission calculation\n\nThe emission calculation shall be performed according to Annex VII except as set out in this section. The additional requirements set out in point 7.1 shall apply for mass-based calculations and the additional requirements set out in point 7.2 shall apply for molar-based calculations.\nThe emission calculation requires knowledge of the composition of the fuels being used. When a gaseous fuel is supplied with a certificate confirming the properties of the fuel (e.g. gas from bottles) it is acceptable to use the composition specified by the supplier. Where the composition is not available (e.g. pipeline fuel) the fuel composition shall be analysed at least prior to and after the engine emission test is conducted. More frequent analysis shall be permitted and the results used in the calculation.\nWhere the gas energy ratio (GER) is used it shall be consistent with the definition in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016\/1628 and the specific provisions on total hydrocarbon (HC) limits for fully and partially gaseous-fuelled engines in Annex II of that Regulation. The average value of GER over the cycle shall be calculated by one of the following methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nFor hot-start NRTC and RMC NRSC by dividing the sum of the GER at each measurement point by the number of measurement points;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFor discrete-mode NRSC by multiplying the average GER for each test mode by the corresponding weighting factor for that mode and calculating the sum for all modes. The weighting factors shall be taken from Appendix 1 of Annex XVII for the applicable cycle.\n\n\n\n\n7.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mass-based emission calculation\nSection 2 of Annex VII shall apply except as set out in this section.\n7.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dry\/wet correction\n7.1.1.1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Raw exhaust gas\nEquations (7-3) and (7-4) of Annex VII shall be used to calculate the dry\/wet correction.\nThe fuel specific parameters shall be determined in accordance with point 7.1.5.\n7.1.1.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diluted exhaust gas\nEquation (7-3) with either equation (7-25) or (7-26) of Annex VII shall be used to calculate the wet\/dry correction.\nThe molar hydrogen ratio \u03b1 of the combination of the two fuels shall be used for the dry\/wet correction.

The use of a zirconia-type sensor to determine the air fuel ratio is not allowed.\nIn the case of testing engines subject to steady-state test cycles only the exhaust gas mass flow may be determined by the air and fuel measurement method in accordance with equation (7-15) of Annex VII.\n7.1.3.2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Determination of the gaseous components\nPoint 2.1 of Annex VII shall apply except as set out in this section.\nThe possible variation of fuel composition will influence all the ugas\n factors and molar component ratios used in the emission calculations. One of the following approaches shall be used to determine ugas\n factors and molar component ratios at the choice of the manufacturer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\nThe exact equations in point 2.1.5.2 or 2.2.3 of Annex VII shall be applied to calculate instantaneous values of ugas\n using the instantaneous proportions of liquid and gaseous fuel (determined from instantaneous fuel consumption measurements or calculations) and instantaneous molar component ratios determined in accordance with point 7.1.5; or,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nWhen the mass-based calculation in section 2 of Annex VII is used for the specific case of a dual-fuel engine operated on gas and diesel fuel, tabulated values may be used for the molar component ratios and ugas\n values.

 Whereas, by letter dated 7 February 1991 from their Ministry of Economic Affairs, confirmed by letter dated 10 April 1991 from the Office of their Permanent Representative to the European Communities, the Dutch authorities requested the Commission to  provide that exploitation of geographical areas for the purpose of exploring for or extracting oil or gas should not be considered in the Netherlands to be an activity defined in Article 2 (2) (b) (i) of Directive 90\/531\/EEC and that entities carrying  on such an activity are not to be considered in the Netherlands as operating under special or exclusive rights within the meaning of Article 2 (3) (b) of the Directive;  Whereas that request was accompanied by a copy of the laws and regulations in force;  Whereas, by letter of 24 October 1991, the Office of the Dutch Permanent Representative sent the Commission a statement of how the five criteria listed in Article 3 (1) could be satisfied with respect to those laws and regulations;  Whereas additional information and documentation on the regulations or administrative provisions in force was supplied, in accordance with Article 3 (4) of the Directive, in correspondence from the Ministry of Economic Affairs dated 8 April 1992 and  from the Office of the Dutch Permanent Representative dated 20 July 1992 and 6 November 1992;  Whereas, as regards compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 3 (1) of the Directive, the Commission has carried out a detailed analysis of the rules in force in the Netherlands (the Law of 21 April 1810 on mines and quarries (Mijnwet 1810),  as amended by the Mining Law of 1903 (Mijnwet 1903); the Laws of 20 June 1924 and 3 May 1967 on minerals exploration; the Law of 23 September 1965 on exploration for and extraction of minerals on the North Sea continental shelf (Mijnwet  continentaalplat); the Decree of 27 January 1967 implementing Article 12 of the Mining Law and the Decree of 6 February 1976 implementing the same Article, as amended by the Decrees of 20 February 1986 and 4 July 1988; the Decrees of 31 March 1967 and  30 March 1976 implementing Article 3 of the Mining Law and the Decree of 9 November 1983 implementing the same Article, as amended by the Decree of 22 July 1988; the Decrees of 30 October 1968, 14 December 1971 and 15 October 1982 implementing Article 5  of the Mining Law; the Decree of 7 February 1967 governing applications for authorizations and exemptions under the Mining Law, as amended by the Decree of 13 February 1976; and documents containing additional information, used during the procedure for  granting authorizations to engage in exploration or extraction (such as the 'Declaration of priority for geophysical exploration' (2)), and the information distributed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the seventh round of authorizations  (Toewijzing 7e ronde Opsporingsvergunningen)). The findings of the analysis were communicated to the Dutch authorities by letter dated 9 October 1992, and by fax dated 1 December 1992, the main ones being set out below:  - as regards offshore exploration and extraction activities, the provisions of the Law of 23 September 1965 on the continental shelf satisfy the requirements of Article 3 (1) (a) relating to freedom of access; however, as far as onshore exploration or  extraction activities are concerned, although the applicable legislation is broadly in line with the aims of Article 3 (1) (a), it is apparent from the declaration of priority for geophysical exploration, and in particular Articles 5 and 12 thereof,  that firms which are members of NOGEPA (1) receive, if they make an application for authorization, preferential treatment incompatible with the abovementioned provision;  - with regard to offshore exploration and extraction activities, the Law on the continental shelf, and in particular Article 14 thereof, and Articles 5a and 6a of the Decree of 7 February 1967, including its two Annexes, are such as to satisfy the  requirement laid down in Article 3 (1) (b) that the technical and financial capacity of candidates must be established in advance; as far as onshore activities are concerned, however, the nature of the financial and technical information that must be  supplied in support of an application for authorization is specified neither in the Mining Law of 21 April 1810 nor in the Law of 3 May 1967 on minerals exploration, with the result that the requirements of Article 3 (1) (b) are not satisfied,  - only the provisions governing offshore exploration or extraction activities satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 3 (1) (c) relating to the prior establishment and publication of the criteria for assessing the way in which it is intended to  carry out the exploration or extraction; on the other hand, neither the Mining Law of 21 April 1810 nor the Law of 3 May 1967 on minerals exploration gives any indication as to the criteria applied for onshore activities,  - with regard to the requirements laid down in Article 3 (1) (d) relating to the prior establishment and communication of the conditions for carrying out exploration or extraction, the provisions relating to offshore activities in force in the  Netherlands were, in the light of further explanations given by the Dutch authorities, deemed satisfactory; however, although equivalent conditions apply in practice to authorizations for onshore exploitation, the corresponding provisions of the  legislation do not satisfy the requirements of Article 3 (1) (d) since the conditions are not laid down in a binding general instrument which is published in advance,  - none of the general provisions examined lays down any obligation as referred to in Article 3 (1) (e) to provide information on sources of procurement;  Whereas, in response to the comments addressed to them and following a meeting with the Commission held on 4 December 1992, the Dutch authorities agreed in a letter from their Ministry of Economic Affairs dated 18 December 1992 to make the necessary  adjustments and submitted to the Commission the text of the amendments they proposed to make to the laws, regulations and administrative provisions in question; whereas those adjustments were aimed at:  - reproducing the rules on the declaration of priority in a ministerial decree to be published in the Dutch Official Gazette to enable non-members of NOGEPA to obtain a declaration of priority under the same conditions as members,  - establishing, in a ministerial decree to be published in the Dutch Official Gazette, the requirements regarding technical and financial capacity to be met by entities applying for authorization to engage in onshore activities, such requirements being  equivalent to those applied in the case of offshore activities,  - establishing, in a decree also to be published in the Dutch Official Gazette, the objective criteria on which authorizations to engage in onshore exploration or extraction are to be granted;  Whereas, to remedy the shortcomings identified by the Commission, the Dutch authorities communicated, in an annex to the abovementioned letter dated 18 December 1992 from their Ministry of Economic Affairs, the draft texts of two ministerial orders, one  relating to the requirements regarding technical and financial capacity to be met by entities requesting authorization and the other to applications for a declaration of priority;  Whereas, by letter dated 24 February 1993, the Commission informed the Dutch authorities that the provisions of those two draft measures were such as to satisfy the requirements of Article 3 (1);  Whereas the two ministerial orders, one relating to the financial and technical conditions for obtaining authorization and for carrying on activities subject to such authorization and the other to applications for a declaration of priority, were adopted  on 19 July 1993;  Whereas, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the Commission invited interested parties to comment on the Dutch rules and practices; whereas no reply alleging discrimination in the treatment of requests for  authorization to carry out exploration or extraction has been received by the Commission;  Whereas, by the abovementioned letter dated 18 December 1992 from their Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Dutch authorities communicated the text of a draft Royal Decree transposing Article 3 (2) of Directive 90\/531\/EEC into Dutch law;  Whereas a Royal Decree transposing into Dutch law the provisions of Directive 90\/531\/EEC, with the exception of Article 3 thereof, was adopted on 6 April 1993;  Whereas a Royal Decree amending the Royal Decree cited in the preceding recital and transposing Article 3 (2) of Directive 90\/531\/EEC was adopted on 6 July 1993; whereas that Royal Decree guarantees compliance with the principles of non-discrimination  and competitive procurement by entities carrying out exploration or extraction, in particular as regards the information they make available to enterprises concerning their intentions with respect to the award of contracts, and with the obligation to  transmit to the Commission information on the award of such contracts;  Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 (3) of the Directive, the said Royal Decree also refers to the obligations on entities holding authorizations to carry out exploration or extraction issued before 1 January 1993 as regards non-discrimination,  competitive procurement and transmission to the Commission of information on the award of contracts;  Whereas, by letter dated 28 July 1993 from the Office of their Permanent Representative, the Dutch authorities communicated to the Commission the texts of the Royal Decree transposing Article 3 (2) of the Directive and of the two ministerial orders  adopted with a view to bringing the Dutch rules on the granting of authorizations to carry out exploration or extraction into line with Article 3 (1) of the Directive;  Whereas, in accordance with Article 32 (4) to (7) of Directive 90\/531\/EEC, the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts met on 13 October 1993 to deliver its opinion on this Decision,  HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:  Article 1  From 10 December 1993, the exploitation of geographical areas for the purpose of exploring for or extracting oil or gas shall not be considered in the Netherlands to be an activity defined in Article 2 (2) (b) (i) of Directive 90\/531\/EEC, and  entities carrying on such an activity shall not be considered in the Netherlands as operating under special or exclusive rights within the meaning of Article 2 (3) (b) of the Directive.  Article 2  This Decision is taken on the basis of the rules governing the exploitation of geographical areas for the purpose of exploring for or extracting oil or gas and applicable in the Netherlands on 10 December 1993.  Article 3  1. Any laws, regulations or administrative provisions amending the rules applicable on 10 December 1993 to the exploitation of geographical areas for the purpose of exploring for or extracting oil or gas in the Netherlands shall be  communicated to the Commission as soon as they are adopted.  2. Whenever the Dutch authorities decide to grant authorizations to exploit geographical areas for the purpose of exploring for or extracting oil or gas, any documents laying down additional requirements for obtaining such authorization shall likewise  be communicated to the Commission as soon as they are published, in so far as they differ substantially from documents published previously.  3. The information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 is notified to the Commission in order to enable it to assess if it is appropriate to amend, withdraw or maintain this Decision.  Article 4  This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  Done at Brussels, 10 December 1993.

CO2 emissions in Portugal.  \n\n\nOfficial Journal 225 E , 08\/08\/2000 P. 0067 - 0068 \n\n\n\n\n\nWRITTEN QUESTION P-2182\/99by Jorge Moreira Da Silva (PPE-DE) to the Commission(19 November 1999)Subject: CO2 emissions in PortugalThe 1997 Kyoto Conference on climate change saw Portugal, on the basis of its economic backwardness, negotiate the right to increase its CO2 emission levels to the year 2012 by 40 %, against the 1990 levels.While the majority of EU countries agreed to lower their greenhouse gas levels, Portugal became the only country in the EU with the right actually to increase its emission of these gases.However, last week, an exhaustive study on the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions was published by the Environmental Systems Analysis Working Party of the New University of Lisbon.The study concluded that as of now, Portugal has already increased its levels of emissions by 34 % over 1990 values, and forecast that by the year 2010, Portugal will be emitting 62 % more CO2 than in 1990, far more than the extremely generous allowance of 40 % to 2012 actually agreed.Given the seriousness of the situation, will the Commission please tell me, as a matter of urgency:1. The most recent figures it has for greenhouse gas emission levels in Portugal;2. What specific measures the Portuguese Government enacted with a view to controlling and lowering greenhouse gas emissions;3. Whether there are other countries, apart from Portugal, where the discrepancy between the ceilings of CO2 emission levels established in Kyoto and the levels currently forecast for 2012 is so glaring;4. What it intends to do to avoid a potential general failure on the part of the EU Member States to meet the emission levels laid down at Kyoto?Answer given by Mrs Wallstr\u00f6m on behalf of the Commission(20 December 1999)On 16 June 1998, the Council agreed on the contributions of Member States in order to achieve the 8 % reduction commitment of the Community in accordance with Article 4 of the Kyoto protocol. According to this agreement  the so-called burden sharing  the majority of Member States have to reduce their emissions below the 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008-2012. Five countries, among them Portugal, are allowed emission levels above the 1990 base year. However, the increase of these emissions is restricted and, in the case of Portugal, this amounts to 27 % (for the six gases of the Kyoto protocol). This burden sharing agreement was made in view of different social and economic developments in Member States.The study mentioned by the Honourable Member has not been made available to the Commission and therefore can not be commented upon.The monitoring of emission levels in Member States is regulated by Council Decision 93\/389\/EEC of 24 June 1993 for a monitoring mechanism of Community CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions(1) recently amended by Decision 1999\/296\/EEC(2). According to this Decision Member States have to submit annual inventories and provide information on their national programmes to combat climate change. On the basis of this information the Commission will report annually to Council and Parliament about the progress achieved.The most recent greenhouse gas inventory received by the Commission from Portugal was in 1997 and covered the years 1990 to 1994. Figures included in this inventory show a 7,9 % increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 1994 compared to 1990 and an increase of 6 % when summing up the 3 main gases in CO2 equivalent (including methane and nitrous oxide taking into account their respective global warming potential). Unfortunately Portugal has not submitted data for more recent years. The same problem also exists for some other Member States. Furthermore, observed data for the Community as a whole as well as for most of the Member States indicate that CO2 emissions have been increasing since 1994. Presently, CO2 emissions in the Community are at about the 1990 level after having declined between 1990 and 1994.Policies and measures devised by the Portuguese government to combat climate change are listed in Portugal's second report submitted in 1997 to the conference of parties to the framework convention on climate change (FCCC) (available on the United Nations (UN) FCCC web site).The Commission expects to receive in the coming months updated information from Member States with regard to national programmes established under the monitoring mechanism decision mentioned above, as well as national inventory data for 1997 and 1998. The Commission will report next autumn to the Parliament and the Council on the results of its evaluation whether the Community and its Member States are on course to fulfil their commitments under the UNFCC convention, taking into account the requirements of the Kyoto protocol.In line with the Council conclusions of 12 October 1999, the Commission also intends to strengthen and speed up its efforts in the development and implementation of common and co-ordinated policies and measures that can facilitate and contribute effectively to fulfilling the commitments of the Kyoto protocol.(1) OJ L 167, 9.7.1993.(2) OJ L 117, 5.5.1999. \n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n","text_len":5313,"text_n_words":838,"text_n_paragraphs":7,"words2paragraph":119.7142857143}

from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a European Union action plan to combat drugs (1995-1999) (COM(94)0234 - C4-0107\/94)The European Parliament,- having regard to the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament (COM(94)0234 - C4-0107\/94),- having regard to the Treaty on European Union, in particular Article K.1(4) and (9) thereof, and to the EC Treaty, in particular Article 129 thereof,- having regard to its resolutions of 9 October 1986 on the drug problem ((OJ C 283, 10.11.1986, p. 79.)) and 13 May 1992 on the work of the Committee of Inquiry into Drugs Trafficking ((OJ C 150, 15.6.1992, p. 41.)), in connection with the reports of its Committees of Inquiry into the Drugs problem, and into the spread of organized crime linked to drugs trafficking,- having regard to the report of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and the opinions of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Development and Cooperation, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, the Committee on External Economic Relations, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media (A4-0136\/95),A. whereas drugs policy is to be regarded as a shared competence between the European Union and the Member States,B. whereas it is in the interest of the European Union to restrict the demand for drugs, and to take precautions in different forms to combat personal use, dependence and need for drugs,C. whereas the main institutional developments since 1992 have been the coming into force of the Treaty of European Union with its specific references to drugs, the setting up of the Europol Drugs Unit in The Hague, and the setting up of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon, supported by the network of national information centres on drug addiction known as REITOX,D. whereas the rise of new drugs markets and trafficking syndicates in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and the channelling of funds into legitimate business concerns by the Mafia and other criminal organisations are giving rise to new problems,E. whereas, so long as there is a demand for drugs, and there always will be, there will be a supply,F. whereas present policies have by no means prevented illicit drug trafficking from thriving for years now and whereas it is more intense than ever before,G. whereas there is a discrepancy in some European Union Member States between drugs policy actually implemented at regional level and in towns and cities and the official position on drugs at national level,H. whereas methods for collecting information on crops is presently uncoordinated and wildly divergent and whereas monies allocated to eradication of opium and coca plantations and the consequent provision of alternative crops has been largely wasted as the drugs trafficker is always able to increase the price offered for drug crops way above the prices of substitute crops,I. considering the vital importance of a global and integrated strategy to combat the multi-faceted problem of drugs and drug addiction which is linked to social scourges such as social exclusion and unemployment in the European Union,J. considering the lack of adequate financial provisions both at national and EU levels, strongly suggests the use of assets seized in drug enforcement operations to provide increased financial assistance for actions aimed at drug reduction and rehabilitation programmes targeted, particularly, at high risk groups,K. whereas the Commission communication despite many merits including the recognition that the drugs problem must be tackled as an integrated whole fails to put across the problem in human terms, fails to analyse in sufficient detail the causes and effects of this phenomenon and would have been weightier if the Commission had presented the Action plan to combat drugs and the proposals on the prevention of drug addiction as interrelated,L. whereas this is in part due to difficulties arising from the division of competence in drug matters brought about by Article K of the Treaty on European Union,M. whereas high echelons of the European Commission, the United Nations Programme for Drug Control, the State Department in Washington and others have all made it clear that the Treaty on European Union far from improving resolve and effectiveness in tackling drugs on a coordinated basis has led to obfuscation and a new confusion over 'who should be doing what',N. whereas, despite improvements in a number of sectors, there is still insufficient cooperation between countries of the European Union themselves and with the United States; this is instanced by differing individual policies within areas such as the Caribbean and others providing tax havens and easy access for drug traffickers, in linking intelligence centre networks, in cooperation over money laundering techniques and systems and in implementing training and equipment programmes in Eastern Europe particularly along the borders with the EU,1. Calls upon the European Council to adopt the 1995 - 1999 Action Plan which recognises that prevention and harm reduction must be given at least as much attention as the laws and penalties relating to drugs and drug-trafficking and insists that clarity of responsibility between the Commission and the Council must be established to ensure that progress is not delayed;2. Stresses that the Action Plan must tackle all links in the chain, from sourcing through criminal trafficking, to education, health and rehabilitation;3. Calls on the Commission to work out practical details of the action plan as quickly as possible;4. Recommends that the Commission and the Council study and give serious consideration to possible alternatives to strategies pursued so far on the basis of a scientific and statistical study of the actual results of the present strategy;5. Insists on the need for cooperation and not rivalry between the Institutions of the European Union and their related bodies, through a clear setting of objectives and definition of roles;6. Believes that, too often, anti-drugs policies make insufficient distinction between consumers and traffickers and that, in future, efforts should therefore be concentrated on a cracking down on organized crime which runs trafficking in illicit drugs; drug addicts should be offered health care and social welfare programmes that are not likely to be hindered by crackdowns;7. Considers that questions relating to a reduction in demand should be considered on the grounds that the best form of prevention is one involving policies designed to reduce vulnerability which help to reduce unemployment, poverty and social exclusion and eradicate racism and xenophobia and which contribute to greater academic success, better training, better living conditions, greater stability and improved dialogue within both society and the family;8. Wishes to see more extensive cooperation and permanent dialogue with all international organizations involved in combating the drugs problem, and also with the third countries concerned;9. Asks that the report to be drawn up by the Commission in the second half of 1996, together with the adjustments which are deemed necessary, will also be submitted to the European Parliament;as regards the Council10. Pending revision of the Treaties, asks for maximum use of the possibilities for action in the fields of justice and home affairs under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, in particular(i) further increase in police and customs cooperation using intelligent tools such as computer data bases, satellite communication and profiling techniques to combat drug trafficking;(ii) conclusion of the Europol Convention before the Cannes European Council, in conjunction with the adoption of the necessary measures to ensure that the Europol Drugs Unit can operate effectively while the Convention is being ratified, on condition that provision is made for appropriate judicial and (inter)parliamentary scrutiny, for the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Auditors to be given jurisdiction, for practical and effective protection of human rights, of privacy and of the right of the citizens concerned to have access to information where it is collected;(iii) as regards Europol wishes to see the creation of an effective central system for collecting information concerning the activities, methods and development of international organized crime, and drugs trafficking in particular. This should be done in such a way that the information can be used effectively by Member States in dealing jointly and severally with criminals and the syndicates and operations that they organize;(iv) insists that Europol must coordinate its activities with Interpol, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), the GAFI and with United States information sources to eliminate costly and unnecessary duplication and to agree upon roles to ensure maximum effectiveness. Recommends that an international crime committee should be set up to achieve this objective;(v) hopes that arrangements will be worked out in the EU whereby movable and immovable goods seized from persons convicted of drugs-related crimes can be declared forfeit throughout the territory of the Union; the funds collected in this manner should be used to finance rehabilitation and support measures for drug-addicts, prevention of drug addiction, the fight against drug trafficking and cooperation with international organizations;(vi) whilst recognizing that sentencing of drugs traffickers and others involved in the drugs trade must be for national courts to decide, nonetheless strongly recommends that there should be as close an approximation as possible and a full exchange of information between Member States on sentencing practices. In particular this must have as a main objective to give no safe refuge in the EU to large-scale organized criminals and their gangs;(vii) simplifying and speeding up the extradition process between Member States (which up to now have been governed by the European Convention on Extradition, to which all Member States except Belgium are parties), by implementing or agreeing the relevant Conventions on simplified procedures, on which the European Parliament must be consulted by the Council in due time, and on relaxing or removing the legal conditions which enable extradition to be refused;11. Stresses the urgent need for an increase in human and technical resources at the major entry ports of the European Union so that there is no lack in profiling and analytical capability; hopes, wherever possible, that multinational units can be established to facilitate communication with likely countries of destination of suspected drugs shipments and to further improve the technique and use of 'controlled deliveries';as regards the European Commission12. Calls on those Member States which have not yet fully implemented the EC Directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering to do so as soon as possible; considers that it should be extended to other countries, in particular those of the EEA; calls for more thorough and coordinated measures to be taken within the EU and with FIN-CEN in the United States to tackle this increasingly important dimension in world organized crime and calls for proposals for more thorough and coordinated measures to tackle money laundering, stressing the special responsibility of banks and financial institutions for ensuring that their training arrangements concerning interception techniques are effective and that there should be dramatically increased investment in the latest techniques and equipment for tracking black money movements and those that organize these; stresses that the focus should be on investigating in which areas of the economy proceeds from crime are reinvested and what impact such reinvestment has on the sectors concerned;13. Considers that legislation should be adopted concerning the prevention of money laundering involving the economic sectors which are increasingly used for such a purpose;14. Calls on the Commission to look into reports by the European media that certain European countries are producing narcotic substances for the purposes of trafficking;15. Asks the Commission to promote in the framework of Directive 91\/308\/EEC the constitution of a permanent coordination body between the financial institutions of the Member States in order to exchange information concerning suspicious transactions and to support all police cooperation bodies within Europe involved in combating drug trafficking;16. Underlines its recommendation to establish closer links between large chemical manufacturers and chemical associations and to eliminate obstacles to inspection;17. Considers it essential for Community law on the control of the illegal production and sale of certain substances used in the production of narcotics and psychotropic drugs to be extended to all the Member States and taken up by all the EEA countries. Also considers that it should continue to be incorporated into bilateral agreements to be concluded with all sensitive third countries;18. Subscribes to the Commission's call for the setting-up of a centralized system for collecting scientific data based on a technical analysis of drug seizures in Europe;19. Calls for a detailed assessment to be made of pilot alternative-development projects in countries producing drug crops;20. Asks for a coordinated full-scale survey across all states of the EU and in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe of the growth of organized crime linked to drugs trafficking and money laundering, but also of corrupt practises involving government bodies and politicians, which benefit organized crime;21. Calls for the promotion of even better international cooperation by EU countries, always within the framework of the UN Drugs Control Policy and its Conventions;22. Requests a comprehensive survey into the state of drugs and drug addicts within prisons across the EU and policies effected to assist drug addicts in prisons, to rehabilitate themselves into society after release, and wherever possible to find alternatives to prison for drug users where other crimes are not involved;23. Recommends, with the information available from these surveys, to examine the effects of drugs policies being carried out in different countries, including aid initiatives, in order to ascertain which are most effective and so come close to a common approach to the whole subject of tackling crime and the drugs problem in the most effective way possible, in terms of both crackdowns and prevention, and to make the results of the surveys available to both the European Parliament and national parliaments;24. Stresses that such an examination should include an in-depth comparison between the risk-reduction policies being carried out by cities such as Frankfurt, Hamburg, Amsterdam and Zurich, which are signatories to the Frankfurt resolution of 22 November 1990 and are members of the organization European Cities on Drug Policy (ECDP) on the one hand and the stricter drug control policies being carried out by cities such as Berlin, Dublin, London, Paris, Madrid and Stockholm and 19 other European cities which are signatories to and members of the 'European cities against drugs\u00a8;as regards the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drugs Addiction (EMCDDA)25. Recognizes that in the EU there are different approaches to the drugs problems as instanced by the attitude towards cannabis in the Netherlands compared to Germany, and consequently stresses the need for the Centre to set out those differences through multidisciplinary research associating policy options such as repression, prevention and harm reduction and also the situation in the field of public health, criminality and corruption, in coherent policy impact reports; also stresses the need for the Centre to give priority to establishing a data base showing the number and trend of different drugs being used, the effects upon users and addicts, the findings of both medical and epidemiological research and research into the background to and social reasons for drug use and the responsibility of drug users themselves; the data base should also stress the efficacy of different measures being applied at not only national but also regional and local level, the effect of criminal acts being carried out by drug users to obtain monies for purchasing drugs and the consequent stability of society, with the data base relating to each aspect of the policies in force and of the pilot projects so as to provide an accurate assessment of their scope, costs and effectiveness, taking account of the health and social aspects, the aspects concerning crackdowns by the police, customs authorities and the courts, and the economic, financial and criminological aspects, etc.;26. Insists that, from the outset, it should provide for effective communication between its central data base and national data bases to make maximum use of existing collections of knowledge and to avoid duplication. Common analytical methods must be agreed with the Centre and with Member States for collecting drugs data; insists that one of the first priorities for the Drugs Monitoring Centre must be to examine the fundamentals of why people take drugs and what measures have succeeded best in preventing and alleviating the problem;27. Takes the view that it is essential for multidisciplinary research that the Centre has at its disposal at all times the most recent information from the Member States on legal aspects, the allocation of responsibilities among the various levels of government, prevention policy and treatment, and practical information and statistics on trafficking and use, transmissible diseases, crime and safety;28. Notes that the EMCDDA's is called on to play a central role in the implementation of the action plan and hopes that it will be provided with all the technical, human and financial resources which it needs in order to operate satisfactorily;29. Considers it essential for the EMCDDA's annual reports, the three-year work programme and other documents drawn up by the governing body to be submitted in addition to the European Parliament;30. Considers it essential for the workings of the EMCDDA to be transparent so that it is trusted by the general public, and calls for easy access by public bodies to the information gathered and the statistical data produced by the Centre;as regards the Member States31. Calls upon the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference to bring the fight against drugs within the remit of Community policy, so that it is no longer seriously hampered by division between the three pillars, compounded by further divisions of competence within the third pillar;32. Requests the Member States concerned to implement into national law the EC directive on chemicals and precursors without further delay, and to sign the UN convention on the manufacture and marketing of substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic and synthetic drugs;33. Calls on those Member States which have not already done so, to introduce policies to reduce risks connected with drug use;34. Proposes that, in addition to cooperation at European level, Member States also enter into an intensive dialogue and cooperate on a regional basis, at urban level and in border regions, in the context of which specific experience concerning drugs policy at regional level, in towns and cities and in border regions should serve as the basis for debate;35. Proposes that a national drugs intelligence unit be set up in each EU country, wherever possible incorporated in, but as a distinct part of a National Criminal Intelligence Service, and in each country bordering with the EU, and that they be properly financed, and manned by trained staff;36. Stresses the need to raise awareness and dialogue concerning the matter of arrest, trial and sentencing, and to make a serious effort to bring current practices closer together, whilst recognising that this has to remain a matter to be decided upon and implemented within each Member State;37. Prompts the Member States to engage in more cooperation in the criminal justice field on drug-related crime, in particular with regard to extradition, and urges that cooperation at local level between police services, the judicial authorities and aid workers be encouraged;38. Urges the Member States to devote more resources to their national programmes for the training of counsellors and to programmes for the rehabilitation of drug addicts within society, taking into account experiences at EU level and actively promoting the best methods of rehabilitation and the dissemination of information;39. Urges that Member States consider improved ways in which to obtain and coordinate information from banks that will allow an effective trace to be put on transactions suspected to be linked to drug profits;as regards producing countries40. Asks for far better cooperation in the compilation of meaningful statistics on the areas given over to the seeding, growing and harvesting of opium, coca and cannabis crops using the latest satellite techniques backed up by systematic 'on the ground' surveys;41. Stresses the importance of providing an alternative in supplier countries, so that growing crops for purposes of drug production is no longer a vital necessity for farmers, notably through joint actions under the common foreign and security policy or under cooperation agreements with third countries (Lom\u00e9 Convention and development policy);42. Hopes to receive from the Commission evaluations of its participation in UNDCP programmes and, in particular, to be regularly informed on the extent to which the people concerned in the growing countries are involved in the planning and implementation of drug-substitution programmes, as urged in the Commission's remarks on budget heading B7-5080;43. Considers it important to promote alternative trading options for the drug- growing countries and urges the Commission to support 'fair trade' projects and imports from drug-growing countries so that more farmers may have an opportunity to grow crops other than drugs and market them at attractive prices;44. Welcomes the retention of the GSP in the agreements already drawn up and those still under negotiation, provided that it first undergoes accurate, systematic, independent periodic assessment which will reveal its actual effects on reducing the production of raw materials intended for the manufacture of drugs;45. Believes that the GSP must be of direct benefit to impoverished farmers who have hitherto sought to make a living by producing raw materials for drugs, or are in danger of doing so, and wishes to be kept informed by the Commission of the percentage of the GSP for which the sectors referred to account;46. Wishes to be informed by the Commission of the measures it intends to take in the Andean region and in the Central American countries to promote the growing of legal crops to which the GSP does not apply;47. Considers it essential for future agreements with sensitive countries to be properly thought out and to involve extensive local dialogue, so as to ensure that they include new ways of encouraging crop substitution by means of support for the establishment of other activities in agriculture, trade and industry which are economically attractive to the local people;48. Wishes to see a substantial change in the way money is expended on crop eradication and substitution; in this respect points to the relative failure of the United States and others to make headway in Peru and Bolivia and of the United Nations and others to progress in both South East Asia (Burma) and North West Asia (Afghanistan) and notes that the southern CIS states provide new and fertile ground for the growing of both opium poppy and cannabis;49. Calls on the Commission to carry out a study of the rise in drug production associated with the increase in exports of cheap foodstuffs from the EU to the drug-growing countries and to inform it of any conclusions drawn from this study;50. Points out that the elimination of crops by aerial methods can only be carried out with due regard to environmental safety and to the living conditions of the local population;51. Points out that any cultivation of narcotic crops for the first time in new areas needs to be dealt with speedily and effectively as this has nothing to do with the 'traditional' livelihood of local farmers; insists that any trade agreements made by the EU with drug crop growing countries must take into account their willingness to reduce the areas under cultivation;52. Considers that support should not be provided for crop eradication through the use of repressive measures;as regards the financial implications53. Considers that the drastic reductions of public financing in national budgets, especially in health care, render impossible any policy of care and prevention and stresses the need for a sufficient provision for the next five years in the European Union budget;54. Demands an assessment of the efficacy of devoting scarce funds to eradication and crop substitution as compared to criminal intelligence and improved surveillance and detection work at the borders;55. Asks for every assistance possible through the PHARE and other programmes to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for devising their own drugs prevention policy and their own harm reduction strategy, as well as for bringing their own intelligence services and operational resources up to the mark;56. Recommends greater cooperation between Member States and the United States in training and equipping customs and police in the countries of the former Soviet Union and, in particular, European participation in the new US- instigated Hungarian National Police Training Academy;57. Calls for the allocation of confiscated funds, in addition to the extra monies needed from the EU and national budgets, firstly to improve prevention policy and harm reduction programmes and secondly to provide better police and customs resources in the war against drugs traffickers;58. Recommends that a conference should be arranged to involve Member States, the European Parliament, the European Commission and other relevant bodies, to discuss the present situation in the European Union on the basis of carefully compiled information with emphasis on demand reduction (including a study of the social reasons for drug-taking), as well as on an aid policy assessment;59. Recommends that this conference encourage discussion and analysis of the results of the policies in force as laid down by the relevant 1961, 1971 and 1988 UN Conventions so as to permit a possible revision of those conventions;60. Would like to see more programmes and proposals formulated for the purpose of prevention; stresses that as far as prevention of drug use is concerned, health care measures are not just a matter of care and treatment of the sick; on the contrary, the health promotion approach, which stems from the principle 'prevention is better than cure', is aimed at addressing problems at their source, i.e. encouraging individuals to adopt a responsible lifestyle and behaviour; therefore the primary focus of health promotion must be health-oriented rather than disease-oriented (COM(94)0202, pp. 4 and 5, paragraphs 7 and 8);61. Stresses the important complementary and indispensable role of the family and of school in the fight against drugs in connection with preventive measures aimed at children and adolescents; there is a need to make parents and teachers fully aware of their educational responsibilities; one reason young people take drugs is a lack of a sense of purpose in their lives; moreover, education should tackle escapism at an early age and teach children to face up to problems;62. Recognising the different aspects to the drugs problem, which results in a disparate number of budget lines, recommends that an annual report should be submitted by the Commission to the Civil Liberties Committee showing how monies have been expended on drugs action programmes and related activities and with what result;63. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, the governments and the parliaments of the Member States, and of the applicant states to the Union and to the governments of the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Council of Europe and the United Nations.  \n\n\n\n\nTop  \n\n","text_len":29208,"text_n_words":4521,"text_n_paragraphs":7,"words2paragraph":645.8571428571}

Together the activity in these two sectors\n2\n accounted for 6.7% of the total value added of France in 2015. Similarly, their share in total employment\n3\n was 5.5% in 2015, of which 5% in the transport sector and 0.5% in the energy sector. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: Eurostat)\n\n\nThe decarbonisation of the energy and transport sectors will require significant investments and economic activity beyond the remit of these sectors themselves. The energy transition implies a structural shift in economic activity. Energy-related investment and jobs will in part migrate from traditional fossil fuel based activities towards construction, equipment manufacturing and other services related to the deployment of low carbon and clean energy technologies. At the moment, the efforts related to the low-carbon and clean energy transition in sectors beyond energy can only be partially quantified and are therefore not included in this analysis.\n\n\nIn the case of renewable energy sector, both the direct as well as the indirect effects on employment are being estimated. According to EurObserv'ER, in 2015, the share of direct and indirect renewable energy related employment in total employment of the economy in France was at about 0.63%, above the EU average of 0.54%. The turnover of the renewable energy industry in the same year was estimated at around EUR 20.03 billion, the biggest part being attributed to the biomass followed by photovoltaic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: EC based on Eurobserv'Er and Eurostat)\n\n\nAn indication of the level of investments in the energy sector in France is given by the Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF)\n4\n. These investments, in the electricity and gas sectors, which are taken as reference sectors, have been on an increasing trend since 2010. They represented around 0.7% of the country's GDP in 2015, higher than in the pre-crisis period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: Eurostat)\n\n\nIn terms of trade, France is a net importer of fossil fuels and a net exporter of electricity. The trade deficit in energy products has fallen from about 2.4% of GDP in 2006 to 1.8% in 2015 influenced by improvements in energy efficiency and an increase of domestic renewable energy sources and by the decrease in the prices of energy commodities. The largest decrease is accounted for by petroleum products. The trade deficit for gas is on a decreasing trend since its peak in 2011\/2012. It amounted to 0.5% of GDP in 2015, which was similar to its level in 2007. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(source: Eurostat)\n\n\n\n2.Energy security, solidarity and trust\n\n\n2.1.Energy Mix\n\n\nFrance's average energy mix has a much higher share of nuclear energy (43.7% vs 13.6%) compared to the EU average. Conversely, fossil fuels are much lower than the EU average (with respectively 13.6% vs 22% for natural gas, 30.3% vs 34.4% for oil, and 3.4% vs 16.2% for solid fuels). The renewable energy portion is also lower (8.5% France vs 13% for all EU), and the gap with the EU average has been widening since 2001 because the increase of renewable energy is slower in France than in the EU overall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (Source: Eurostat)\n\n\n\n2.2.Import dependency and security of supply\n\n\n46% of France's energy consumption is met by imports, somewhat less than the EU average (54.1%). This is due to the high importance of nuclear energy in the energy mix which represents almost half of the country's energy needs\n5\n. The overall energy import bill for 2015 amounted to 39.7 billion euros (far behind the 69 billion paid in 2012), representing 1.8% of the GDP. This decrease can notably be explained by the fall in international fossil fuel prices. \n\n\nThe overall import dependency of France recorded a decrease of about 5.6 p.p. between 2005 and 2015, whilst at the EU level, import dependency increased by 1.9 p.p. over the same period. France imported almost all its fossil fuels needs in 2015, but the diversification of its import sources coupled with its good capacity levels at interconnection entry points and LNG terminals as well as adequate storage facilities make the French market less vulnerable than most Member States in relation to security of supply. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0(source: Eurostat)\n\n\nImports of natural uranium and nuclear fuels are not included in Eurostat's energy balances and therefore import dependency cannot be calculated in the same way as for the main fossil fuels. France is importing most of its natural uranium needs from five main countries (Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia, Australia and Niger), relying on all major suppliers. The uranium bill represented less than one billion euros in 2015, to be compared to the 39 billion for fossil fuels. Concerning nuclear fuel cycle services (conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication), EDF (the operator of the 58 nuclear reactors) is supplied by Areva to a large extent but also by other competitors such as Urenco (Great Britain-Netherlands-Germany), Tenex (Russia) or Westinghouse (USA-Japan). Therefore, import dependency risks on nuclear fuel are mitigated by good supply diversification of the entire chain of the nuclear fuel cycle. EDF also holds strategic inventories of nuclear materials and additional stocks of reprocessed uranium which provide further security of supply.\n\n\nThe security of gas supply Regulation requires that, if the single largest gas infrastructure fails in one Member State, the capacity of the remaining infrastructure is able to satisfy total gas demand during a day of exceptionally high gas demand. France complies with this rule thanks to its gas infrastructure which includes seven major interconnection entry points and three LNG terminals, allowing an access to gas from the North Sea (mainly Norway), Russia, the Netherlands, North Africa (mainly Algeria) but also more generally to the international LNG market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: gas coordination group)\n\n\n\n3.Internal market\n\n\n3.1.Interconnections and wholesale market functioning\n\n\n3.1.1.Electricity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0(source: EC based on ENTSO-E scenario outlook and adequacy forecast 2014)\n\n\n\n\n(sources: EC services based on Eurostat for the left graph  and based on Platts and European power exchanges for the right graph)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, France's level of electricity interconnection\n6\n was 9.4%, close to the 10% target set by the European Council for 2020. Nevertheless, the country is on the path to reach the 10% target by 2020 through the completion of PCIs currently under way.  France had 12 GW import capacity and 17.4 GW export capacity in 2016, making it a net exporter to all neighbouring countries with the exception of Germany. Further market integration and new interconnection capacities with the Iberian Peninsula, such as the Biscay Bay HVDC subsea cable and two other projects across the Pyrenees have been given priority in the Madrid Declaration signed in 2015 and would benefit consumers and businesses. The Biscay Bay project, France \u2014 Spain interconnection between Nouvelle Aquitaine (FR) and the Basque country (ES) will bring the interconnection level to 5000 MW by 2025. The two planned projects for increasing the interconnection with France through the Pyrenees with estimated commissioning date on 2026 will increase the interconnection up to 8.000 MW.\n\n\nThe French electricity market is characterised by a very strong concentration of the market share in the power generation, as well as in the supply market on all market segments, from households to big industrial consumers, with EDF - the incumbent - remaining the dominant market player. An increase in the market share of alternative suppliers to EDF can however be noticed on big industrial sites (reaching a market share of 46%, against 13% for households). This can be explained by the end of regulated tariffs for this category of consumers, while regulated prices remain, alongside with \u201cmarket offers\u201d, for those who have subscribed less than 36 kVA.\n\n\n\n\nFrance is part of the North West Europe market. Despite reinforced market coupling, wholesale prices have not fully converged over the 2011-2015 period, in particular due to episodes of interconnections saturation. Prices differ in particular when there is a massive influx of electricity from renewable sources in Germany, which reduces wholesale prices and can occasionally cause negative prices due in particular to the limited flexibility of the power generation park both in France and Germany.\n\n\nWholesale electricity prices in France remain below the EU average thanks to the low marginal costs of nuclear power generation (2 \u20ac\/MWh below the EU average in 2015) although since 2008 the price differential with the EU average has narrowed substantially, mostly due to a faster reduction in EU prices. French wholesale prices remain higher than in Germany (8 \u20ac\/MWh. in 2016). \n\n\n3.1.2.Gas\n\n\nThe concentration observed in the gas market is much lower than in the electricity market, and the concentration index is well below the EU average. Wholesale prices are on par with EU average.\n\n\nIn the gas sector, France is well connected. A new LNG terminal in Dunkirk commissioned in December 2016 allowed for the creation of a new interconnection point with Belgium. The High Level Group for Interconnections in South-West Europe set in 2015 aims at enabling increased interconnection capacity through targeted projects between France and the Iberian Peninsula such as the Eastern gas axis through the phased development of Midcat if the studies being made presently confirm the interest of this project.\n\n\nThe creation of one single market zone in France is ongoing and on track, and will be completed by end 2018 through the commissioning of the PCI Val-de-Saone, co-financed through EEPR (European Energy Programme for Recovery). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: ACER for the left graph and EC services based on on Platts, gas hubs, Eurostat for the right graph)\n\n\n\n3.2.Retail electricity and gas markets\n\n\n3.2.1.Electricity\n\n\nIn 2016, households' electricity prices in France were below the EU average. Between 2013 and 2016, average band retail electricity prices for households increased, due to the increase in electricity network costs and taxes and levies (mainly network costs such as the TURPE, \"tarif d'utilisation du r\u00e9seau public de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\" and the CSPE, the \"Contribution au service public de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\", which includes renewable levies), similar to EU average.\n\n\nRetail electricity prices are correlated to the existence of regulated tariffs (TRV, i.e. \"tarifs r\u00e9glement\u00e9s de vente\") that accounted at the end of 2016 for 86% of residential customers. As part of the opening up of markets to competition, residential and business customers have the choice between TRV, offered only by EDF and local distribution companies, and market offers offered by all energy suppliers including historical suppliers. The principle of reversibility makes it possible to switch from TRV to market offers and vice versa without limitation. Between 2011 and 2015, the annual switching rate for households was on average 3.5%, below the EU average (5.8%).\n\n\nThe deployment of smart meters (Linky) has started in December 2015 and will continue until 2021, although it is facing some opposition among French households. It should help limiting electricity consumption of households and therefore lead to lower energy costs and prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: ACER)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    (source: Eurostat)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0       (source: Eurostat)\n\n\n\n3.2.2.Gas\n\n\nThe opening to competition of the gas market is now very advanced, especially on the non-domestic consumers market. The market offers (vs. the regulated tariffs \u2013 TRVs - accessible for households) are largely the majority in volume (86%) and concern more than 50% of sites at the end of 2016. Market share of alternative suppliers reached 23% in volume of consumption in the household segment and 67% in the non-residential one. The market offers pull prices down with discounts up to 15% in comparison to the TRVs.\n\n\nAs for electricity, households may choose between TRVs with historical suppliers, or market offers with alternative ones (or historical suppliers). In such a context, switching rates have increased much more than in the electricity market, from 4.5% in 2011 to 7.7% in 2014 and 9.4% in 2015 (vs 4.3% the same year for electricity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: ACER)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(source: Eurostat)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(source: Eurostat)\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3.Market performance indicators\n\n\nAccording to the periodical survey of the European Commission (DG JUST), French consumers are more satisfied than the average EU consumer about the services received on energy retail markets (84.6% vs 75.3% for electricity, and 83.9% vs. 78.1% for gas).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(source: DG JUST survey)\n\n\n3.3.Energy affordability \n\n\nEnergy poverty is less of an issue in France than in other EU Member States, as the energy expenditure share in overall consumption of the poorest households is lower in France than in many other Member States: the share of energy in total household expenditures of the lowest quintile of the population is among the lowest in the EU (5.7% vs. 8.6% in 2014). However, 16.3% of the citizens below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold in 2015 (vs 12.9% in 2005) consider that they are unable to keep their home adequately warm, despite the fact that protection measures for vulnerable consumers are in place, such as social tariffs for electricity and gas, soon to be replaced by \"energy cheques\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (source: ad-hoc data collection of DG ENER based on HBS with the support of Eurostat and national statistics)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.Energy efficiency and moderation of demand\n\n\nSince 2005, France has decreased its primary energy consumption by 8% to reach 239.3 Mtoe\n7\n in 2015 and its final energy consumption also decreased by 10% to reach 144.1 Mtoe\n8\n in 2015, whereas the GDP increased by 9% over the same period. These figures - together with the primary energy intensity which decreased by 1.7% every year (on average) since 2005 \u2013 reflects the general decoupling between economic growth and energy consumption. However, even if France has reduced the gap towards its indicative national 2020 targets for energy efficiency (219.9 Mtoe in primary energy consumption and 131.4 Mtoe in final energy consumption, both targets excluding international transport), the rapid and thorough implementation of the \"Energy Transition for green growth\" Act\n9\n of 17 August 2015 is required to further tap into the significant potential for energy demand reductions in areas such as the building sector in order to achieve its targets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: Eurostat)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough primary energy intensity decreased over the 2000-2015 period, it was at a slower pace than the EU average, putting France slightly above the EU average in terms of performance (i.e. with a higher intensity: 114.1 toe\/mn EUR of GDP, vs. 113.3 for the EU). In 2000, France was 9th in terms of primary energy intensity, and 13th in 2015, behind countries like Spain, Germany and the UK.\n\n\nThe structure of final energy consumption per sector is quite similar to the EU average. In 2015, transport was the biggest energy consuming sector representing a 34.7% share in the total final energy consumption, which is very close to the EU average (i.e. 33.1%), followed by residential sector (26.1% vs 25.4% for the EU average), industry (19.9% vs. 25.3%) and services (15.6% vs. 13.6%). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: Eurostat)\n\n\nFinal energy intensity levels are decreasing at a slower pace than the EU average but the trends remain encouraging in most sectors. In the industry and services sectors, final energy intensity levels remain well below EU average, reflecting the improvements in energy efficiency realised over the past decade. However, the final energy consumption per m\u00b2 of floor area of residential building (climate corrected) is slightly above EU average. Additional efforts could therefore be envisaged to accelerate the energy renovation of residential buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: Eurostat)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(source: Eurostat)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0       (source: Odyssee database)\n\n\nIn the transport sector, the final energy consumption remained stable over the period 2005-2015 but since 2013 it started increasing to reach a level above its 2011 level, while GDP increased by 0.9% per annum on average. Passengers transport activity increased in 2015 by 5.8% as comparing to 2005. This trend in final energy consumption can be explained by the decrease in freight transport activity, which decreased by 16.5% over the period 2005-2015 but also by more energy-efficient new cars. In addition, the share of collective passengers land transport has slightly increased, indicating a lower use of private transport.\n\n\n\n\n(source: Eurostat)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        (source: Eurostat and DG MOVE pocketbook)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (source: Eurostat)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe French transport policy framework is developed around three priorities:  (i) to end the road transport paradigm, (ii) to develop passenger public transport, and (iii) to reduce air transports pollution. In terms of infrastructure, priority is given to the improvement of existing networks and the development of clean alternative modes of transport to the air and the road.\n\n\nThe Energy Transition Act has established the objectives of a new energy model in France and aims to foster \"green growth\" by reducing energy costs and favouring energy efficiency, renewable energies and the circular economy. It sets targets for the promotion of energy efficiency, renewable energies and the use of cleaner modes of transport. At the local level, the development of urban mobility plans \u2013 \"Plans de D\u00e9placements Urbains\" (PDU) \u2013 is mandatory in urban transport perimeters of urban agglomerations with more than 100,000 inhabitants, and must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.Decarbonisation of economy\n\n\n5.1.GHG emissions\n\n\nIn 2016 GHG emissions in France were 16.4% below their 1990 levels, slightly above the EU average of -22.1%. According to the latest national projections in a with existing measures scenario, the level in France's non-ETS greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 is projected to be 20% lower than in 2005. France is consequently expected to achieve its 2020 target under the Effort Sharing Decision by a 6 pps gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: EC and EEA)  \n\n\nAccording to 2016 European Environmental Agency (EEA) estimates, the GHG intensity of France's economy is well below the EU average, since 1990, decreasing however slightly slower than in the EU. In 2016 the GHG emissions per capita in France were also significantly below the EU average. GHG emissions have continuously decreased since 1990s thanks to large reductions in industry and energy production, as well as the high nuclear share. Emissions of the transport sector have shown a rising trend between 1990 and 2004 with an increase of 20%, followed by a slight decrease of 7% between 2004 and 2008, and a stabilisation since 2008.Emissions in the residential\/tertiary sectors have shown a rising trend between 1990 and 2005 (+20%), followed by a decrease between 2005 and 2015 (-19%). French authorities have introduced under the 2014 Finance Act a carbon element in the energy tax which is proportional to GHG emission content imposed to sectors outside the ETS.\n\n\nIn 2015, the largest sectors in terms of GHG emissions were the transport sector (29% of the total GHG emissions) followed by industry (20.8%), agriculture & fisheries (19.8%) and the residential sector (16.5%). One particularity of this structure concerns the power sector, mainly based on nuclear energy, and therefore contributing to 10.1% only of the total emissions. In relative terms, the GHG emissions from transport and agriculture were well above the EU average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: EC and EEA)  \n\n\nIn France, agriculture has a relatively large share in national emissions (over 15% on average 1990-2013) and higher than average share of agriculture in the Effort Sharing sectors. Emissions in agriculture have been slowly decreasing since 1990 (-4.4% between 1990 and 2015).   \n\n\nPreliminary accounts under the Kyoto Protocol for France show overall removals of -5.9 Mt CO2-eq. as an annual average in the period 2013-2015. For comparison, the annual average of the EU-28 accounted for removals of -119.0 Mt CO2-eq. It should be noted that in this preliminary simulated accounting exercise, removals from Forest Management did by far not exceed the accounting cap. \n\n\nEmissions by Deforestation are slightly higher than removals by Afforestation. The relative importance of removals by Forest Management, at a similar level as other activities in 2013, reduced over time. Overall, there is a decreasing trend in removals, mainly due to previously noted declining removals by Forest Management. Removals by Afforestation slightly increased while emissions by Deforestation remained unchanged over the course of the three-year period. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Forest Management credits are capped and presented as yearly averages when the total Forest Management credits of the considered period exceed the simulated cap over the same period.\n\n\n(source: EC and EEA)\n\n\n\n\nCO2 emissions in transport and alternative fuelled vehicles\n\n\nIn 2015, road transport emissions were 10.7 % higher than 1990 levels. Average emissions for newly registered cars are low with a level of 109.8 g CO2\/km and decreased by 28 % between 2005 and 2016, similar to the EU average. The National Low Carbon Strategy has set indicative emission targets. For the transport sector, the indicative target is a reduction of 29 % by 2028 compared to 2013, and by 66 % by 2050 compared to 1990. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(source: European Environment Agency)\n\n\nThe number of electric charging points in France has over the period 2013 to 2016 increased significantly, reaching 15 843 units in 2016.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(European Environment Agency) \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0       (European Alternative Fuels Observatory)\n\n\nNational Policy Frameworks under Directive 2014\/94\/EU on alternative fuels infrastructure have to establish targets, objective and measures for the development of the market of alternative fuels in the transport sector and the deployment of the relevant infrastructure. France has submitted its National Policy Framework as requested under article 3 of the Directive 2014\/94\/EU. \n\n\nA detailed assessment of the French National Policy Framework in terms of its compliance with the requirements of Directive 2014\/94\/EU on alternative fuels infrastructure, its contribution to achievement of long-term energy and climate objectives of the Union and coherence of its targets and objectives in terms of cross-border continuity has been published as part of the Communication on Alternative Fuels Action Plans (COM(2017)652) and\u00a0 the related staff working document SWD(2017)365. \n\n\n5.2.Adaptation to climate change\n\n\nIn France, a National Adaptation Strategy was adopted in 2006 and the National Adaptation Plan was adopted in 2011, covering 20 thematic areas: cross-cutting actions, health, water, biodiversity, natural hazards, agriculture, forests, fisheries and aquaculture, energy and industry, transport infrastructures, urban planning and the built environment, tourism, information, education and training, research, funding and insurance, coastlines, mountains, European and international actions, and governance. A second adaptation plan is foreseen for adoption in 2017. As the integration of adaptation into sectorial policies is part of the NAP's specific actions and measures, the monitoring scheme looks at a qualitative assessment of the status of implementation of the 230 measures in the different sectors.\n\n\n5.3.Taxes on energy and transport and fossil fuel subsidies\n\n\nThe overall tax burden on energy and transport (including carbon taxation) in relation to GDP amounted to 1.9% in 2014, nearly 0.5 p.p. lower than the EU average. This relative gap is quite stable since 2005. Taxation of heat and electricity is lower than the EU-average, but has shown a steep increase since 2005. The tax burden on transport fuels has in contrast fallen since 2005, while it has remained broadly stable for vehicles. The tax burden on vehicles was significantly lower than the EU average at that time.\n\n\nFrance uses taxation as part of its climate policy, and has a carbon tax in place. In 2017, it amounts to \u20ac30.5\/tCO2, and was increased in early 2016 by 8.5\u20ac\/tCO2. It is applied on transport and heating fuels as well as on natural gas and coal. Revenues from this carbon tax were estimated at 2.3 billion EUR in 2015 and 3.8 billion EUR in 2016. The Energy Transition Act\n10\n established a long-term trajectory for this tax to 56 EUR in 2020 and to reach a rate of 100 EUR per tonne of CO2 in 2030.\n\n\nFor vehicles a revenue neutral bonus-malus system is applied. In addition, excise duties on diesel have increased in 2017 (by 0.01 EUR per litre) while they have decreased on petrol by the same amount. As a result the taxation gap between diesel and petrol is closing but still remains.\n\n\nFuel taxation in France is above the EU average. The road fuel excise duties on petrol are the eighth highest among EU Member States, and the excise duties on diesel are the fifth highest (EEA, 2016). In the context of the 2016 Finance Act, France decided to converge the tax rates on diesel and petrol over the next five years. For 2017, the tax difference is at 0.10 EUR\/litre and the government announced a total convergence by 2022 in its Climate Plan. An important measure to incentivise the purchase of low-CO2 emitting cars is France\u2019s \u2018bonus-malus\u2019 system. Based on the CO2 emissions of the purchased car, the government offers a bonus payment (credit) on the purchase of low-emitting cars, and levies an additional fee (tax) on the purchase price of high-emitting vehicles. The government regularly adjusts the emission levels for eligible cars. \n\n\nIn July 2017 the Government published a comprehensive Climate Plan with new targets and tools addressing both cross-cutting and specific sectors. Regarding transport, a fund for sustainable mobility and alternative fuels is scheduled, and a plan to end the sales of GHG emitting vehicles by 2040 is included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: Eurostat)\n\n\nFossil fuel subsidies have increased in France in the last decade, predominantly driven by the reduced rates of excise tax applicable to certain users of diesel fuel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: OECD\u00a0Inventory of Support Measures for Fossil Fuels 2015) \n\n\n5.4.Renewable energy \n\n\nThe share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption reached 15.2% in 2015, which is approximately 1-percentage point below its interim-target objective for 2015\/2016 (16%). \n\n\nRenewable energy developments will also need to be significant in the medium term to comply with the ambitious objectives of the Energy Transition Act, in particular the objective of having 32% of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030. In that respect, investor confidence in France would be reinforced by further certainty on the concrete measures planned to achieve the objective of decreasing the share of nuclear electricity to 50% by 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (source: Eurostat-SHARES)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: Eurostat-SHARES)\n\n\nConcerning electricity from renewable energy sources (RES), France is almost in line with its planned trajectory set in the National Renewable Energy Action plan (NREAP). In 2015, the country was approximately 2-percentage points behind its objective (18.5% vs 21%), which is not negligible. Renewable electricity is mainly promoted through feed-in-tariffs up until now, but the Energy Transition Act has set a feed in premium system (\"compl\u00e9ment de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration\") to support PV, onshore and offshore wind, as well as hydroelectricity and bioenergy. Moreover, the Ministry for Ecological and Inclusive Transition  publishes calls for tenders in order to support the development of  renewable energy projects, such as photovoltaic plants, large solid biomass plant or offshore wind farms. \n\n\nConcerning the RES share in heating & cooling, the French NREAP anticipates a share of 33% for in 2020. However, since 2010, the actual deployment has constantly been below the planned trajectory. Moreover, the spread between the anticipated share and the effective share has increased. Low prices of fossil fuels these last years create a negative incentive for renewable heat projects, although the government helps these projects via tax credits or subsidies of the ADEME (agency for environment and energy efficiency).\n\n\nIn the field of transport, according to the NREAP, the anticipated national RES share is 10.5% by 2020. Since 2010, France is on track regarding its planned trajectory. If the current trend is maintained, the country is projected to be almost in line in with its 2020 anticipation. Due to a very important diesel fueled car market, France is by far the top European biodiesel consumer. The country owns a structured biodiesel industry with some of the main European producers.\n\n\nThanks to the deployment of renewables since 2005, it is estimated that France avoided in 2014 about 6% of fossil fuel use in gross inland consumption and about 4.8% of GHG emissions at national level, which is below the EU average\n11\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (source: EEA)\n\n\n5.5.Contribution of the Energy Union to better air quality\n\n\nAir quality in France continues to give cause for severe concern. For the year 2013, the EEA estimated that about 45,120 premature deaths were attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and 8,230 to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations\n12\n. \n\n\nFor both pollutants France reported exceedances of the binding EU air quality standards\n13\n. For the year 2015, France reported exceedances of the limit value for PM10 in 6 out of the 76 air quality zones in France, while exceedances of the limit value for PM2.5 were reported in 1 zone, and of the limit value for NO2 in 15 out of 76 zones\n14\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: EEA)\n\n\nThe health-related external costs from air pollution in France have been estimated to be more than\u00a0EUR 37 billion\/year (income adjusted, 2010), which includes the intrinsic value of living a healthy life without premature death as well as the direct costs to the economy such as healthcare costs and lost working days due to sickness caused by air pollution\n15\n.\n\n\nIn order to meet air quality targets, France published in May 2017 a national action plan, le Plan national de r\u00e9duction des \u00e9missions de polluants atmosph\u00e9riques (PR\u00c9PA)\n16\n, setting out measures to reduce emissions of air pollutants from different contributing sectors. \nLocal authorities were also involved in drawing up the PR\u00c9PA and its implementation. \n\n\nThe Energy Union can further contribute to addressing these air quality problems through measures reducing emissions of both emissions and air pollutants such as PM and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from major contributing sectors such as (road) transport, energy production, industry and residential heating (e.g. stoves and boilers) as shown in the figure below\n17\n. In this context, Paris announced its ambition to electrify nearly all of its public transportation by 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: EEA. This table reflects only sources of primary PM2,5 emissions.) \n\n\n6.Research, innovation and competitiveness \n\n\n\n\n6.1.Research and innovation policy \n\n\nFrance adopted in 2016 a National Research Strategy for Energy, as requested by the Energy Transition Act of 2015. The broad 'Programme d\u2019Investissements d\u2019Avenir' (PIA) is a major instrument for clean energy research & innovation (R&I) funding in France. A first round of this programme was launched in 2010 and a second one in 2014. Within this framework, the Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) manages around EUR 3 billion of financing for the 2010-2020 period. ADEME has launched a series of calls for demonstration projects in the field of clean energy. So far, more than 620 projects have been supported with EUR 2.1 billion. An additional 15 calls were opened at the beginning of November 2016 on various topics linked to the French participation in the international initiative Mission Innovation initiative (see below).\n\n\nThe National Research Agency (ANR) operates another PIA programme called 'Instituts de la transition \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique' (ITE), with EUR 1 billion funding during the 2010-2020 period. The ITE programme brings together private companies and public laboratories to create new institutes dedicated to R&I in the field of clean energy\n18\n. \n\n\nIn addition to the PIA programme, ANR also runs a basic research funding programme based on annual calls for projects focused on the priorities defined in the French National Research Strategy, which includes a 'clean, secure and efficient energy' challenge similar to that in the Horizon 2020 programme (see below), focused on five areas: (a) Dynamic management of energy systems; (b) Multi-scale governance of new energy systems; (c) Energy efficiency in all fields of the economy; (d) Reduced need for strategic materials; (e) Decarbonisation of energy and chemistry sectors.\n\n\nThese focus areas are also followed by the main energy research entities (CEA, IFPEN, CNRS, universities\u2026), which are grouped in a 'research alliance' dedicated to energy called ANCRE (\"Alliance Nationale de Coordination de la Recherche pour l'Energie\").\n\n\nFrance is a very active contributor to the ongoing work of the Strategic Energy Technologies (SET) Plan. It participates in all the temporary working groups for the implementation of the integrated SET Plan, leading the one dedicated to batteries and co-leading the one dedicated to nuclear safety.\n\n\nRegarding the Horizon 2020 programme, France has received so far 8.2% of the EU contribution devoted to the 'secure, clean and efficient energy' part of the programme. As of September 2017, 287 participations from French organisations have been awarded over EUR 148 million in Horizon 2020 energy projects. This includes a grant of EUR 8.4 million to Fonroche Geothermie for its participation in project DEEPEGS (deep enhanced geothermal systems), and eight grants totalling almost EUR 7.8 million to French beneficiaries participating in project SMARTER TOGETHER (smart and inclusive solutions for urban districts).\n\n\nFrance is a founding member of Mission Innovation\n19\n. As a result, it has committed to doubling its state funding\n20\n in clean energy R&I from the baseline level of EUR 440 million in 2014 to EUR 880 million in 2020. These investments will focus on renewable energy, energy storage, carbon capture storage and use, and innovations aiming at improving energy efficiency (including in industry, buildings, transport, circular economy, and smart grids). They will cover the whole chain of innovation, from basic research to demonstration.\n\n\n6.2.Investments and patents in the Energy Union R&I priorities \n\n\nIn 2015, France was the EU Member State with the highest public (national) investments in the Energy Union R&I priorities. R&I investments reached EUR 1\u00a0023 million, having decreased by 3% compared to 2014. The highest share of investments (44%) was attracted by the Nuclear Safety priority of the Energy Union, followed by the Sustainable Transport and Smart System priorities (21% and 19% respectively). In the period 2007-2015, the maximum annual public investment was EUR 1\u00a0109 million, reported in 2011. In 2014, the most recent year for which data from most Member States are available, public investment per GDP in France was higher than the EU average. \n\n\nPrivate investment in the Energy Union R&I priorities in 2013 was estimated at EUR 2\u00a0582 million (16% of the private R&I investment in Energy Union R&I priorities in the EU). The focus was on Sustainable Transport, which received 33% of these investments, followed by the Smart System priority with a share of 25%.\n\n\nIn 2013, the most recent year for which complete patent\n21\n\u00a0statistics are available, 409 companies and research organisations based in France filed 1\u00a0030 patents in low-carbon energy technologies (16% of the EU total). The focus was on Sustainable transport (35%), followed by the Smart System (22%) and Efficient Systems (19%) priorities.\n\n\nIn 2013, private R&I investment and patents in the Energy Union R&I priorities were higher than the EU average, when normalised by GDP and by population respectively. In the period 2007-2013, both private R&I investments and the number of patents in Energy Union R&I priorities increased on average by 10% and 20% per year, increasing faster than the indicators at EU level (6% and 15% respectively).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNote: The international comparison (right) is shown for 2014 (France had reported EUR 1 054 million). Reporting at EU level for 2015 is not as complete, and very few countries have reported for 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Data sources: Public investment as available in the International Energy Agency RD&D Statistics database\n22\n for codes relevant to Energy Union RIC priorities. Patent data based on the European Patent Office PATSTAT database\n23\n. Private investment as estimated by JRC SETIS. Detailed methodology available from the JRC\n24\n.)\n\n\n6.3.Competitiveness\n\n\nIn 2014, the real unit energy costs (RUEC)\n25\n in France (at 16% of value added) were slightly above the EU average (15.3), around two times more than those in the US but below those in Japan and China. Over the recent years, energy intensity improved but electricity prices increased, resulting in an overall increase in real unit energy costs. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(source: ECFIN)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                   (source: ESTAT and IEA)\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the competitiveness in wind and solar energy, France does not show a revealed comparative advantage in either sector as indicated by a value of this indicator\n26\n below 1. This means that France exports proportionally less of wind and solar technologies, when compared to its total exports, than other countries do. Nonetheless, when looking at the different components of the value chain for each technology, France displays a comparative advantage in power electronics. When looking at the trade balance (the difference between exports and imports), it shows France is a net importer of solar photovoltaic components and products\n27\n, while it exhibits a trade surplus in wind energy technologies due to its strong position in the power electronics market segment that compensates for the trade deficits in the other parts of the supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(source: UN comtrade)\n\n\n\n7.Regional and local cooperation\n\n\nFrance is a founding member of the Pentalateral Energy Forum created in 2005, together with Benelux, Germany, and Austria (joining the Forum in 2011), in order to promote collaboration on cross-border exchange of electricity. It counts more than one third of EU population and covers over 40% of the electricity generation in the EU. The Pentalateral forum was the first region to publish a regional Generation adequacy assessment (in March 2015), which is an important step to better assess the generation needs across borders, improving the integration of markets by minimizing the tendency for national solutions to adequacy concerns. In May 2015, it launched flow based market coupling, an improved version of market coupling, calculating transmission capacity in a dynamic manner and a world premiere. \n\n\nFrance is also a Member of two regional High Level Groups (Northern Seas and South West Europe).\n\n\nThe Northern Seas HLG was established through a political declaration with the participating countries\n28\n and the Commission on 6 June 2016. The declaration sets as objective to facilitate cost-effective deployment of offshore renewable energy and to facilitate the further interconnection between Northern Sea countries and the further integration of wholesale electricity markets. It is estimated that the potential of wind resources in the region could meet up to 12% of the EU's entire electricity demand, which needs to be supported by an optimised transmission network. \n\n\nThe South West HLG (which includes Portugal, Spain and France) was established in March 2015 by heads of States. It promotes projects to increase the interconnectivity of the Iberian Peninsula electricity markets with the remaining European markets. These projects comprise an interconnection for electricity in the Biscay Bay as well as two additional interconnections through the Pyrenees. The three Member States also agreed to assess the gas interconnectivity between the three countries, the \"Eastern Axis\". One of the projects is currently known under the name MIDCAT, which will allow for bidirectional flows between the Iberian Peninsula and France. The Midcat project can be realized in two steps, with project STEP as a first phase to increase the bidirectional flows between the two countries. \"Val de Sa\u00f4ne\" will offer by 2018 increased North to South flows in France along the Eastern gas Axis from the Iberian to France.\n\n\nThe EU macro-regional strategy for the Alpine Region in which France takes part can be used as a basis for regional cooperation on energy. European Territorial Cooperation \u2013'Interreg' \u2013 under EU cohesion policy also provides further opportunities for cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, including in the Energy Union areas.\n\n\nCities and urban areas have a key role in the energy and climate challenge. The Urban Agenda for the EU, established by the Pact of Amsterdam in May 2016, better involves cities in the design and implementation of policies, including those related to the Energy Union. It is implemented through Partnerships, in which the Commission, Member States, cities and stakeholders work together on a number of important areas, including on Energy Transition, Urban Mobility, Air Quality, Climate Adaptation and Housing. France is participating in the partnerships on Energy Transition and Climate adaptation, as member.\n\n\nBy 2016, in the context of the Covenant of Mayors, the sustainable energy action plans delivered by 78 French municipalities had been assessed. Overall, these 78 municipalities cover about 13.7 million inhabitants. These municipalities committed to reducing GHG emissions by 23.6% by 2020 (as compared to 1990 baseline). In addition, 5 cities (covering 1.20 million inhabitants) have committed to conduct vulnerability and risk assessment and develop and implement adaptation plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: JRC 2016. Notes: SEAP=sustainable energy action plan, GHG=greenhouse gas emissions)\n\n\n8.Cohesion policy and EU clean energy investments \n\n\nEU cohesion policy makes a key contribution to delivering the Energy Union objectives on the ground, through European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) aiming to implement energy policy objectives in France which are complemented by national public and private co-financing in order to achieve optimal leverage. Cohesion policy also ensures integrated territorial solutions to energy and climate challenges, supports capacity building and provides technical assistance.\n\n\nOver 2014-2020, cohesion policy is investing some EUR 1,228 million in energy efficiency improvements in public and residential buildings and in enterprises, as well as in high-efficiency cogeneration and district heating, renewable energy and smart electricity distribution grids in France. Cohesion policy is also investing significantly in R&I and in SME competitiveness, based on the regional strategies for smart specialisation. Many regional strategies include a focus on energy, mobility and transport. Furthermore, the areas of specialisation in the fields of materials, mechanics and chemistry as well as the \"factory of the future\" cover eco-innovation issues. Finally, many smart specialisation areas chosen by the French regions (building, mobility, energy, agribusiness etc.) are strongly characterised by their sustainability. At this stage, at least EUR 137 million is foreseen for investments in R&I and adoption of low-carbon technologies in France, but this might increase further in line with the evolving content of the smart specialisation strategies. A further estimated EUR 811 million is invested in supporting the move towards an energy-efficient, decarbonised transport sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(source: DG REGIO)\n\n\nThese investments are expected to contribute to around 143,000 households with improved energy consumption classification, a decrease of around 83,197,000 kWh per year of primary energy consumption of public buildings, around 11,500 additional users connected to smart grids and 750 MW of additional capacity of renewable energy production, as well as to around 50 km of reconstructed or upgraded railway lines and 600 km of new or improved inland waterways. Overall, the EU cohesion policy investments in France over 2014-2020 are expected to contribute to an estimated annual decrease of GHG emissions of around 3,989,000 tonnes of CO2eq.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, during the 2007-2013 period, the French regions massively reprogrammed European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) programmes to finance energy renovation in social housing. A specific financial instrument (\"\u00e9co-pr\u00eat logement social\") was created to speed up energy renovations, and ERDF was used in a grant scheme as an additional financial resource. EUR 220 million of ERDF generated EUR 1.5 billion of total investment. With the average ERDF investment being EUR 3,276 per dwelling (17% of total investment), some 70,000 low-income households could benefit from improved energy performance and some 20 000 local jobs were created. \n\n\nAs another example, the CAP TRI investment fund project in Hauts-de-France shows how to usefully combine support from the ESIF and the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), in particular as it enabled maximising the private sector participation. The project is a part of a low-carbon economy strategy in the region (Third Industrial Revolution - TRI) intending to make the region a \"zero-emissions\" energy model by 2050, through investments in the fields of renewable energies, energy efficiency, energy management and smart grids, smart transport and circular economy. CAP TRI is a \"layered\u201d fund\" which invests risk capital in enterprises developing TRI projects: the region participates, using ERDF funding, providing equity financing alongside public and private investors. The European Investment Bank (EIB), supported by the EFSI, provides mezzanine debt to the fund and commercial banks provide senior debt at project level. \n\n\nAs a further example, faced with a quasi-permanent saturation of the road network a large project to improve public transport in Martinique improved the conditions of travel and accessibility, reduced the environmental nuisances associated with the preponderance of private car use, reduced travel times for public transport users, and promoted intermodal practices. There are 14 intermediate stations along the road lane reserved for public transport and two new exchange centres with relay stations in Mahault and Carr\u00e8re to improve the service to users from the north and south of Martinique. The multimodal pole of Pointe Simon was reinforced and the implementation of high-performance equipment and road transport systems ensured a major qualitative leap in the public transport service, including increased frequency and improved passenger information systems. The project has improved traffic conditions for approximately 70% of the population of Martinique and ensured better access to commercial and business areas and the airport. The contribution from the ERDF was EUR 66,2 million.\n\n\nThrough its support to sustainable transport systems, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) also contributes to the goals of the Energy Union. Following French participation in the CEF \u2013 Transport 2014-2015 Calls, the current French action portfolio comprises 65 signed grant agreements, allocating EU 1,907.4 million of actual CEF Transport Funding to French beneficiaries (state-of-play February 2017)\n29\n. The transport mode which receives the highest share of funding is inland waterways (IWW) (41.4% of actual funding). The actions aim to upgrade the IWW network, and so far the CEF Programme is mainly targeting the development of the Havre-Paris and Seine-Escaut axes, in particular the waterway connection between France and Belgium.\n\n\nIn the maritime portfolio, France is engaged in improving the infrastructure of its major ports to reduce the maritime and fluvial bottlenecks. Furthermore, France is intensifying its efforts in upgrading its maritime links through more performant ships and increased handling efficiency of ports. Together with other Member States, France is progressing in developing the intermodal freight transportation by designing a sustainable incentive scheme and an investment programme to provide integrated short-sea-shipping along the pre-defined 'Atlantis' Motorway of the Sea freight route. France also participates in projects promoting the use of LNG fuel and of greening technologies for vessels. As regards to alternative fuels, France has several road actions, as well as a number of multimodal actions focusing on the promotion of LNG fuel. For the rail transport, France is committed to ongoing works along the Mediterranean and Atlantic corridor. France is also involved in studies along the Mediterranean, Atlantic and North-Sea Mediterranean Corridors, which will prepare future construction phases.\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n The indicators used in this country factsheet largely build on indicators developed for the Commission Staff Working Document \"Monitoring progress towards the Energy Union objectives \u2013 key indicators\" (SWD(2017) 32 final) \nhttps:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/sites\/beta-political\/files\/swd-energy-union-key-indicators_en.pdf\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gross value added and employment in NACE sectors D-Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply and H-Transportation and storage\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 National accounts, Eurostat\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gross fixed capital formation consists of resident producers\u00b4 acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed tangible or intangible assets.
